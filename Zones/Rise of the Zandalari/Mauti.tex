Nodding to Grent, he starts tracking the beast as you follow him. After a few long minutes in the jungle, you find the dead body of a great panther on the floor of the jungle. Is this Mauti ? What could have killed it ?

\says{52346}{51038}  % Let's see what we got here...
\says{52346}{51039}  % Hmm...  The beast looks smaller than I would have thought.

Suddenly, a giant black panther jumps out of the surrounding jungle, bites at Grent, then jumps back running into the jungle, carrying his dwarven prey with it.

\says{52346}{51007}  % It's got me!

\startID*{29116}  % Follow the Cat

You follow the white flares of Grent accross the jungle. Mauti moved so fast in its familiar jungle habitat... You fear you are not going to reach Grent in time. The path of flares dangerously nears Zul'Gurub, then takes a path on a rise on the side of the troll city, then suddenly stops near the entrance to a cave. Mauti is sleeping. Did the run exhausted her so much ? Did grent injured her on the way here ? Wait, \textit{Grent} ! Where is he ?

Before you can retake your breath, a troll spirit appears hovering above Mauti's body.
