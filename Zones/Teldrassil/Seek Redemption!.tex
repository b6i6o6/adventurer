As you walk towards the inn, you are accosted by one of the druids of Dolanaar.

\start{Seek Redemption!}

Ashamed of having been fooled by the Zenn, you set out in the woods in search of Fel Cones. One you have found a few of them, you make your way back to where you met the satyr.

\progress{Seek Redemption!}

As you give the Fel Cones to Zenn, he begins to eat them.

\complete{Seek Redemption!}

Sudenly, he falls to the ground as his body contorts and he is turned into a Toad of Warty Complexion.

\miss{Zenn Foulhoof says: Ribbit! No!! This cannot...ribbit...be! You have duped me with...ribbit...your foul trickery! Ribbit!}

Amused by the trick, you make your way back to Dolanaar and recounts the event to Syral Bladeleaf.

\start{Nature's Reprisal}

Overhearing the conversation, Tallonkai Swiftroot tries to draw your attention without alerting anyone else. Noticing him, you approach him, curious.

\start{Twisted Hatred}

As you exit Dolanaar from the west in search for the Fel Rock cave, you notice a fallen tree is slightly obscuring a small passage through the hills. This must be the way to Fel Rock.

As you enter the cave, you are attacked by Shadow and Rascal Sprites, vicious grellkins. As you fight your way in, you remember the Ireroot Seeds that Syral gave you. You throw one of them on the ground at the grells feeet. The seeds instantly grow from the ground and constrict the grells until they die.

Your make your way further into the cave and are surprised to find it filled with giant roots, ferns and moss, as a river runs inside the cave and into a small underground lake. Despite this, the foul atmosphere of the cave is uncomfortable, as it is infested by Vicious Grells. You continue to throw Ireroot Seeds away to kill the grells until you notice a satyr overlooking the lake from higher grounds. This must be Lord Melenas.

Making your way up to him, you engage the satyr. Lord Melenas is first taken aback by your incursion in Fel Rock, then regaining his composure he suddenly shapeshifts into a great cat. You now understand why Tallonkai considers him an embarassment, as this satyr actually used to be one of the druids. Upon dying, Melenas turns back to a satyr as you cut his head off for Tallonkai.

Not wanting to carry the foul thing for an extended period of time, you run towards the cave exit and return to Tallonkai in Dolanaar.

\progress{Twisted Hatred}

% TODO: I'm not sure it's clear that Tallonkai is a druid, make him come from the druid house of dolanaar for the emerald dreamcatacher maybe ?
You give the druid the satyr's head.  % TODO: something like "you are happy to part with the head"

\complete{Twisted Hatred}

You walk to Syral and recounts what happened in Fel Rock and how the Ireroot Seeds were invaluable for killing the innumerous grells.

\complete{Nature's Reprisal}

Having restored your standing with the Council of the Forest, you finally can take a well earned rest at the inn.
