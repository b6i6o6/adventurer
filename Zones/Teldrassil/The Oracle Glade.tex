On your way to Wellspring Hovel, you stop by Dolanaar as Corithas is waving at you from the moonwell.

\start{Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei}

Taking the road to the west in direction of Darnassus, you pass by Moon Priestess XX and continue your way accross a bridge and to Wellspring Hovel. You notice a planter with a night elf beside it. Figuring this must be Rellian, you accost him. % bogling attack or remains from another player ?
% TODO: I redacted Denalan's presence here because:
% 1. It does not make sense to ask us to give the seeds to Rellian if he was going there anyway
% 2. Later in the quests he says he rushed here, so I'll have him appear at that time instead.

\progress{Rellian Greenspyre}

You show Rellian the Timberling Seed that Denalan gave you.

\complete{Rellian Greenspyre}

\start{Mossy Tumors}

Accepting the task from Rellian, you follow the road then turns north at the crossroads, in direction of Wellspring Lake and the the Oracle Glade.

Along the way, you notice that the nightsabers are pressuring the wildlife of Teldrassil. No matter where you look, you can spot rabbits and dears fleeing from their predators. Some Elder Nightsabers are even bold enough to attack you on the way. Now that you have witnessed firsthand the dire state of Teldrassil's balance, you understand why Ilthalaine tasked you to kill young nightsabers back in Shadowglen.

% D'abord le lac ou d'abord le moonwell et le glade ?
