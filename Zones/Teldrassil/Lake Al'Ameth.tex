As you exit the inn and take the direction of the lake, Syral Bladeleaf accosts you.

\start{Denalan's Earth}

% TODO: describe the timberlings, who are not bog creatures !
You take the package from the druid and make your way south. On your way to the lake, you are attacked by strange bog creatures who seem to be agitated by some foul magic. You manage to flee from them and reach a small tent by the lake where Denalan is making experiments in his a planter. The herbalist notices you as you approach his camp.

\progress{Denalan's Earth}

You hand Denalan the package of Rare Earth from Syral Bladeleaf in Dolanaar.

\complete{Denalan's Earth}

\miss{Denalan says: Now let us place this rare earth in my planter...}

Denalan walks to his planter and places the earth in it, trying not to mix it with the rest.

\miss{Thank you again, Adventurer. This rare earth will be very helpful in my experiments.}

% TODO: the timberlings are not "bog" creatures, they are more like made of vines ?

\start{Timberling Seeds}

You realize that the creatures that attacked you on your way to the lake were actually what Denalan is calling Timberlings.

\start{Timberling Sprouts}

As you venture into the woods around the lake, you notice green "vine-like" "protub√©rances" dotting the ground in some places. Considering Timberlings are found all around them, you figure these are probably the sprouts that Denalan wants you to gather. You kill the Timberlings around the sprouts and rummage through their corpse to find Timberling Seeds.

While running around the lake gathering Timberling Sprouts and Seeds, you notice a Strange Fruited Plant, which is three times your height, with enormous leaves hanging down a strange, ominous, purple glow around it.

\start{The Glowing Fruit}

Making your way back to Denalan,

As you want to show him the Glowing Fruit you found around the lake, Denalan notices your impatience.

\progress{The Glowing Fruit}

You give the Glowing Fruit to the herbalist.

\complete{The Glowing Fruit}  % TODO: he says "Azeroth" when he might mean "Eastern Kingdoms", I need to redact this !

Denalan removes the seeds from the Glowing Fruit and walks back to his planter.

\miss{Denalan says: Let's see how these seeds grow in my prepared soil...}

Denalan plants the fruit seeds along the Timberling Seeds and watch them grow in his planter. After a few seconds, three Boglings erupt from the planter as the startled herbalist runs back to his tent. They look like Timberlings but these are younglings and with a darker shade of green.

\miss{Bogling says: KILL!!!}

Clearly these young Timberlings are not more docile that their parents. It is unclear whether the fruit is a manifestation of the corruption of Teldrassil's soil of if it is actually the source of the corruption of the Timberlings. The boglings defeated, Denalan regains his composure.
