As you exit the inn and take the direction of the lake, Syral Bladeleaf accosts you.

\start{Denalan's Earth}

% TODO: describe the timberlings, who are not bog creatures !
% TODO: better describe the Timberlings the first time we encounter them as we end up having one as friend for some time.
You take the package from the druid and make your way south. On your way to the lake, you are attacked by strange bog creatures who seem to be agitated by some foul magic. You manage to flee from them and reach a small tent by the lake where Denalan is making experiments in his a planter. The herbalist notices you as you approach his camp.

\progress{Denalan's Earth}

You hand Denalan the package of Rare Earth from Syral Bladeleaf in Dolanaar.

\complete{Denalan's Earth}

\miss{Denalan says: Now let us place this rare earth in my planter...}

Denalan walks to his planter and places the earth in it, trying not to mix it with the rest.

\miss{Thank you again, Adventurer. This rare earth will be very helpful in my experiments.}

\quotes{Denalan}

% TODO: the timberlings are not "bog" creatures, they are more like made of vines ?

\start{Timberling Seeds}

You realize that the creatures that attacked you on your way to the lake were actually what Denalan is calling Timberlings.

\start{Timberling Sprouts}

As you venture into the woods around the lake, you notice green "vine-like" "protub√©rances" dotting the ground in some places. Considering Timberlings are found all around them, you figure these are probably the sprouts that Denalan wants you to gather. You kill the Timberlings around the sprouts and rummage through their corpse to find Timberling Seeds.

While running around the lake gathering Timberling Sprouts and Seeds, you notice a Strange Fruited Plant, which is three times your height, with enormous leaves hanging down. The plant looks sick with red moss at the top and a strange, ominous, purple glow around it.

\start{The Glowing Fruit}

Continuing to survey the surroundings of the lake, you see a huge black Timberling along the waterline. Killing the beast, you rummage through its corpse to find the seeds it contains.

\start{The Moss-Twined Heart}

Having found enough seeds and sprouts, you make your way back to Denalan.

As you want to show him the Glowing Fruit you found around the lake, Denalan notices your impatience.

\progress{The Glowing Fruit}

You give the Glowing Fruit to the herbalist.

\complete{The Glowing Fruit}  % TODO: he says "Azeroth" when he might mean "Eastern Kingdoms", I need to redact this !

Denalan removes the seeds from the Glowing Fruit and walks back to his planter.

\miss{Denalan says: Let's see how these seeds grow in my prepared soil...}

Denalan plants the fruit seeds along the Timberling Seeds and watch them grow in his planter. After a few seconds, three Boglings erupt from the planter as the startled herbalist runs back to his tent. They look like Timberlings but these are younglings and with a darker shade of green.

\miss{Bogling says: KILL!!!}

Clearly these young Timberlings are not more docile that their parents. It is unclear whether the fruit is a manifestation of the corruption of Teldrassil's soil or if it is actually the source of the corruption of the Timberlings. The boglings defeated, Denalan slowly regains his composure as you show him Blackmoss's heart.

% \progress{The Moss-twined Heart}  % He says Hello etc so it's hard to place it.
\complete{The Moss-twined Heart}

Denalan tries to clean the heart.

\start{Planting the Heart}

Frightene by his last tentativ, the herbalist is slightly afraid to plant the heart himself. You walk to the planter which is filled with soil, specially prepared by Denalan.  %\progress{Planting the Heart}

\complete{Planting the Heart}

You take the Cleansed Timberling Heart from the planter. As it is still pulsing, you let it drop in the grass. Around it, the blades of grass begin to grow and wrap around the heart. More growth ensues yet, and before your very eyes, a very alive Timberling now stands before you. It seems calm and at peace, cleansed of corruption. It stares at you. Denalan is astonished but happy. He directs you to one of his colleagues.

% TODO: fuck, you get a Cleansed Timberling Heart and nothing else... let's plant it and get a timberling
% kill the timberling in the harpy ambush and make him save your life (private joke as I died there)
% No, I'm not killing him, it's too sad, and it has a duration of 20 fucking minutes, it's enough to nearly finish Teldrassil, maybe I can make it go away when I go back to Denalan for the frond
