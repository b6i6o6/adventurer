\textit{After years of imprisonment within the Emerald Nightmare, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage has finally returned to the mortal world. Reunited with his love, Tyrande Whisperwind, Malfurion endeavors now to heal the corrupted world tree, Teldrassil, and rejuvenate the spirit of the night elf people. Yet, as the Great Cataclysm shakes the boughs of their colossal tree, the night elves brace themselves against the coming storm. As war and destruction close in from all sides, it falls to night elves like you to stand strong and protect the enduring legacy of your people.}

You start your journey on Teldrassil, the world tree that is home to the night elves. The tree itself is so huge that it houses entire towns, lakes and woods. All around you are the verdant trees of Shadowglen, colorful in shades of green, purple and yellow. The wood is bathed in a quiet dusk, and dominated by the great tree Aldrassil which lies at the center of the clearing. In front of you is Ilthalaine, the trainer of new Night Elves recruits.

\quest{The Balance of Nature}

Eager to prove your worth to Ilthalaine, you venture into the woods and start culling the population of young Nightsabers, the large saber cats that the Night Elves use as mount. It is a grim task, but keeping the balance of nature is primordial to Teldrassil. After having killed a few of them, you return to Ilthalaine, who is talking with two huntresses on the back of large Nightsabers.

\custom[Quest]{The Balance of Nature}{Notes}

The huntresses gone, Ilthalaine turns to you.

\quest{Fel Moss Corruption} \progress*{Fel Moss Corruption}

Nodding to Ilthalaine, you can't help hearing the two Night Elves talking a few yards away. The male seems to be angry at something, while the female is sitting on a bench. Curious, you decide to get closer, overhearing the discussion.

\quotes[Quote]{Dirania Silvershine}

Noticing your approach, the male turns to you.

\quest{Demonic Thieves}

Resolute that the grells are a nuisance to Shadowglen and Teldrassil as a whole, you venture farther into the woods again, past the Nightsabers area.

You see the grells dwellings, crude camps where these imp-like demons likely store the food that Melithar want you to recover. The grells are numerous but fearful, and they often prefer fleeing rather than helping their comrades as you attack them. Advancing through their territory, you manage to reach their camp where you find the missing food supplies. Inspecting their bodies on your way out of the camp, you find the moss that Ilthalaine wants to examine.

Back near the benches, you approach Melithar.

\progress{Demonic Thieves}

You give him the food supplies you recovered in the grell camp.

\complete{Demonic Thieves}

Thanking Melithar, you turn back to Ilthalaine, handing him the moss.

\start{Priestess of the Moon}

Waving goodbye to Ilthalaine, Melithar and Dirania, you circle around Andrassil and reach the two pools. Between the pools is a female Night Elf and her nightsaber mount. She is crouching besides a lying male. This is probably the Priestess of the Moon that Ilthalaine spoke about.

\start{Iverron's Antidote}

Eying the ground all around the pools, you notice the flowers description. You gather some of them and bring them to Dentaria.

You hand the lillies to Dentaria.

Dentaria uses the lillies and some nature magic on Iverron.

\start{The Woodland Protector}

You go to the northern end of Shadowglen, where you find the Shadowthread cave. Nearing the entrance of the cave, you venture a glimpse inside it and see that it is covered in spider webs. You suddenly notice a dryad which appeared not to be there a moment ago. % Describe the dryad, and she has a blue buterfly turning around her

% TODO: Add to wowpedia in The Woodland Protector
Tarindrella says: You've come to help, adventurer? Let us stay together for a while.

\complete{The Woodland Protector}

\start{Webwood Corruption}

You enter the cave with Tarindrella. The cave is dark and the Webwood Spiders are numerous, but you are not alone, as Tarindrella summons lashers to help you, that she calls Nature's Bite. Advancing through the cave, the webs grow thicker and the foulness of the air is worse and worse. % TODO: Describe the spiders

% TODO: Add to wowpedia to Webwood Corruption
% TODO Tarindrella says: My dear friends... I'm so sorry...
% TODO Tarindrella says: The corruption goes much further than these spiders. I fear the true source is not within this cave.
% TODO: Tarindrella tells us to seek Athridas !
Tarindrella says: Corruption this deep could not have come from the outside.

You venture yet further into the cave. Some of Tarindrella's lashers are being torn apart regularly by spiders but she keeps summoning more of them as needed.

\complete{Webwood Corruption}

\start{Vile Touch}

You venture even further into the cave and you spot a spider that is five times larger than the other ones, this must be the broodmother. As Tarindrella summons new lashers, Githyiss the Vile start to attack you.

% TODO: add to wowpedia to Vile Touch
Tarindrella says: The corruption is buried deep within her.

After the beast is killed, you notice a small totem behind the broodmother's corpse.

% TODO: add to wowpedia to Vile Touch (how to add both of them to the same quest but include them separately ?)
Tarindrella says: This totem has been corrupting the eggs ! It seems a greater threat looms. The Gnarlpine remain tainted by something most foul.

\complete{Vile Touch}

Tarindrella smashes the totem with her hooves.

\start{Signs of Things to Come}

You close your eyes and, in the blink of an eye, you are back between the pools behind Aldrassil, besides Dentaria the Priestess of the Moon, and Iverron who is now standing and looking well. Iverron turns to you.

% TODO: modify the wowpedia page to make it an actual quote

\start{Teldrassil: Crown of Azeroth}

% There are deers by the pools

Circling around the pool and passing behind Aldrassil, you continue northeast until you reach the moonwell. There are deers, nightsabers and boars, and you spot some lonely grells hiding in the leaves. Inside the moonwell, you think you can see a figure, like a spirit starting to appear from the water...

% TODO: There are two events here in the notes, I need a way to target only one of them !
\custom[Quest]{Teldrassil: Crown of Azeroth}{Notes}

Startled, you fill the Crytal Phial that Dentaria gave you with the waters of the well, and proceed to get back to her.

\start{Precious Waters}

Looking towards Aldrassil, Dentaria points to the ramp.

% TODO: again, different Notes here
\custom[Quest]{Precious Waters}{Notes}

You thank her for her help and begin the ascencion of Aldrassil using the ramp around it. Tenaron's house is actually inside the tree, up in its branches. As you ascend the tree, you catch glimpses of conversations of some Night Elves who also live in Aldrassil.

\custom{Doranel Amberleaf}{Conversation}

Continuing your ascencion, you pass by a Shadowglen Sentinel who doesn't seem to notice you, instead continuing her duties. You finally reach the end of the ramp and Teranon's house. He notices you as you enter the alcove.

% TODO: Add this to the page of the quest
Tenaron Stormgrip says: Take with you the blessing of the wind's embrace. May it make your descent from Aldrassil more... direct.
% TODO: Buff: Wind's Embrace, Embraced by the wind, slowing fall speed.

You feel the Wind's Embrace upon your body. You feel light as a feather and understand that Tenaron used his power over nature to grant you a slow fall from Aldrassil so you could reach Dolanaar quicker than by using the ramp down. You say goodbye to Tenaron and exit his house. Using a few metters of the ramp as "Ã©lan", you jump off the fence of the ramp and slowly, quitely, fall towards the roof of the building at the base of Aldrassil. % TODO: this building has not been described previously
Jumping off the roof, your slow fall gets you safely on the ground, where you start heading south east to exit Shadowglen. % TODO: also add "there are some wisps on the trees of the forest"

You follow the paved road that is marked with "lampadaires" which are made of a small tree ("arbuste"), which ends in a bowl-like form and looks like it is hosting a wisp, its light illuminating the road in the twilight of Shadowglen.

The exit of Shadowglen is marked by a Night Elven arch, DESCRIPTION and guarded by Shadowglen Sentinels.
