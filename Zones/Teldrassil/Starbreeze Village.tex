% \progress*{The Emerald Dreamcatcher}  % Mmh... only the beginning makes sense here.
% Dreamcatcher "Uruson" rare, blue-furred furbolg
% describe the furbolgs because it's the first time you encounter them
% first building: table and chairs are broken, book on the ground, but no dreamcatcher
% second building: two broken tables, two broken chairs, three books on the floor, and a dresser ! You rummage the dresser and find the Emerald Dreamcatcher.
% Having what you came for, you avoid the remaining furbolgs that are in the village and around the other buildings and escape Starbreeze Village to return to Dolanaar.
% Return to the guy, second part of the progress, then complete

% Beware, Ferocitas is not in Starbreeze but farther north !
% However, Ferocitas the leader has blue fur, so it's possible to mention Uruson when you go back in Starbreeze to find the injured guy and to reuse this information in Ban'ethil.
% You attack the furbolgs, kill the mystics and warriors, then attack the blue-furred leader. You find Tallonkai's Jewel on his corpse. Then you return to Starbreeze Village (it's very close!) and continue killing furbolgs while searching the buildings for the injured guy. Then it's Ban'ethil, and the "phial can wait" can be reused for the dreamcatcher.

Reassuring him that you will look for his dreamcatcher, you travel east to Starbreeze Village. While on the road, you realize that the buildings that you first saw in the forst while exiting Shadowglen were actually Starbreeze Village. You notice that the moonwell outside the village, and decide to stop by. As you approach the moonwell, a scene comes to life.

\custom[Quest]{Teldrassil: The Refusal of the Aspects}{Quotes}

You fill the Jade Vial that Corithas gave you with waters from the moonwell, then continue your way and head into Starbreeze Village. However, you discover that the village has been overrun by the Gnarlpine furbolgs, who attack you on sight.

Fighting your way to the first building, you start to look for the Emerald Dreamcatcher. Nothing of note is in there though, so you try your luck with the second floor.

While the second floor still provides no clue to the whereabouts of the dreamcatcher, you find a night elf body lying on the floor. Leaning over him, you realize he is not dead yet but is gravely injured and probably won't survive for long.

\start{Gnarlpine Corruption}

Understanding the gravity of the situation, you run off as quickly as possible to return to Dolanaar in order to warn them. You don't have time to drag Gaerolas away, and the dreamcatcher will have to wait as well. % TODO: we won't go back, so make us find the dreamcatcher before the guy. Problem is that the dreamcatcher follow-up quest has you go into Starbreeze again, so it needs to be done before we find Gaerolas, since we need to never go back there afterwards, since the urgency of the barrow den is our excuse not to help him.

You pass by Corithas and the moonwell of Dolanaar. The phial can wait for now. You find your way back to the inn and Athridas, who is standing by Sentinel Kyra Starsong, that you can only guess is probably the commander of the Sentinels here in Dolanaar.

Turning around, you notice a Sentinel on a Nightsaber that is very probably Citarre. She stares expectantly at you as you approach her.

\dialogue{Citarre Mapleheart}

Handing you a nightsaber, Citarre helps you to mount on it. Once you are properly secured on the nightsaber, she instructs it to transport you to Ban'ethil Hollow as fast as possible then come back to her.

Obeying her mistress, the nightsaber storms off Dolanaar and runs very fast to the west without ever stopping and hardly breathing. You both cross the path of furbolgs and spiders in the forest, but none of them are able to match the speed of the nightsaber, allowing you to reach Ban'ethil Hollow safely. Upon reaching the entrance of the den, you dismount from the nightsaber and pet it to thank him for his swiftness. Looking happy to have been of help, the nightsaber turns around and starts running back to his mistress.
