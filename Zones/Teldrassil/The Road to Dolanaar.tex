\subzone{The Road to Dolanaar}

Near the arch is a merchant, who waves to you.

\start{Dolanaar Delivery}

Since you were heading there anyway, you agree to help the merchant. You follow the road south until it goes east then reach a crossroads. You read the "panneau" and, since Dolanaar is "pointed" east, you continue the road to the east. If Shadowglen was a wood, the rest of Teldrassil is a forest. Trees of all sizes and colors dot the landscape. The only things that do not look natural here are some buildings in the south, and a strange creature along the road. It is humanoid in form, has light brown fur covering most of his body, big black hooves for feet and two giant horns pointing backwards. Curious, you step closer to him and, has he notices you and turn to face you, you notice he has the characteristic long ears of the elves and a face that, were it not for the fur and horns, could pass for a Night Elf.

\goto{Zenn's Bidding}
% \goto[Yes]{Zenn's Bidding}
% \goto[No]{Arrival in Dolanaar}

Not trusting the satyr and refusing to kill animals for some strange rituals, you continue to follow the road to Dolanaar, as buildings start to appear from between the trees in front of you.
