Your curiousity arroused by the offer, you wander off the road and into the forest to gather the reagents. The spiders of the forest look very similar to the ones back in the cave in Shadowglen. The nightsabers here a bigger than the ones in Shadowglen, but not has big as the ones used by the huntresses as mounts. The owls are inoffensive at first, but do not take it kindly that you try to take their feathers and end up attacking you anyway. When you have gathered all the required reagents, you find your way back to Zenn along the road. % TODO: make it feel bad, as you kill animals !

\progress{Zenn's Bidding}

You hand him your hard-earned prizes.

\complete{Zenn's Bidding}

Zenn hands you a Foul Bag containing a few Severed Voodoo Claws. You are not sure this being really is benevolent in the end... Not wanting to push your luck even further, you decide that passing your way and not asking anything more from him is probably better. Nothing good can come from someone who gives away Severed Voodoo Claws. Resigned, you continue to follow the road to Dolanaar, as buildings start to appear from between the trees in front of you.
