Your curiousity arroused by the offer, you wander off the road and into the forest to gather the reagents. The spiders of the forest look very similar to the ones back in the cave in Shadowglen, but you are happy to kill them in a more open environement this time. The owls are inoffensive at first, but do not take it kindly when you try to take their feathers, forcing you to kill them anyway. The nightsabers here a bigger than the ones in Shadowglen, but not has big as the ones used by the huntresses as mounts. They attack you on sight as you kill the other wildlife in the forest. When you have gathered all the required reagents, you find your way back to Zenn along the road.

You hand him your hard-earned prizes.

\complete{Zenn's Bidding}

Zenn hands you a Foul Bag containing a few Severed Voodoo Claws. You excepted more of a reward for such a gross task and yet you expected it to be less... wicked. You are not sure this being really is benevolent after all...

Not wanting to push your luck even further, you decide that continuing your way and not asking anything more from the satyr is probably better. Nothing good can come from someone who gives away Severed Voodoo Claws to travelers. Resigned, you continue to follow the road to Dolanaar, as buildings start to appear from between the trees in front of you.
