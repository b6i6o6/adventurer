You approach General Hawthorne.

\custom{General Hawthorne}{Gossip Text}

\start{Fields of Blood}

\start{A Line in the Dirt}

As you make your way out of the camp and into the plains, the cook comes at you.

\start{Lion's Pride}

You make your way through the plain, until you reach a small hill where are you place an Alliance banner. A few Alliance Dield Defenders rush to your position and start building walls to defend the hill.  Unfortunately, the banner has not gone unnoticed by the Horde either, as multiple Desolation Grunts attack the hill. They try to burn the banner but you and the defenders are able to keep control of the hill and kill the attackers.

Success! The hill is yours!

As you march further into the plains towards the Quillboar territory,  you are attacked by Plains Pridemane lions. As you manage to kill the beasts, you are ambushed by Desolation Grunts. Exhausted from your fight with the lions,  you are not sure you will be able to overcome your attackers. Hopefully, a Northwatch Recon patrol rushes in to help you. You kill the grunts with the help of the Northwatch Recons, and thank the soldiers as you continue your way to the Quillboar's dwellings.

You enter the Bristleboar challenge ring and uses the Horn of Challenge to challenge Sabersnout to single combat.

A huge armored quillboar enters the ring.

\miss{Sabersnout says: What is this ? <Gurgle> <Snort> The adventurer has come? To challenge mighty Sabersnout <Snort> ?}

Its entire clan is standing in circle around the two of you.

\miss{Sabersnout says: I will make an example of adventurer <Snort>! Prepare yourself <Gurgle> soft-for-face.}

The quillboar charges at you and the crowd cheers as the fight goes on. You gain the upper hand as Sabersnout starts hiding behind his shield.

\miss{Sabersnout says: You, <Snort> you are strong <Gurgle>. But...}

\miss{Sabersnout says: Strong enough for THE BOARCALYPSE?}

From all around you, you can see Bristleback Assault Boars rushing in the challenge ring to attack you.  You are outnumbered but manage to kill the boars regardless.

\miss{Sabersnout says: You... survive the boars? <Snort> So many boars! So sad! <Gurgle> I must break you now!}

Sabersnout, now enraged, lowers his shield and charges at you. You deflect the strike and kill him.

\miss{Sabersnout says: <Snort>? <Gurgle>!}

His entire clan run out of the ring, fleeing in fear.

The deed done, you return back to the camp.
