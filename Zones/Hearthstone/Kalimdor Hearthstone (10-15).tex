You use your Hearthstone and find yourself teleported back in a safe place, away from danger.

\alliance{The atmosphere inside Darnassus is quiet and tranquil. It does not have the feeling of confinement that one would feel in Stormwind or Ironforge, where the buildings are grouped close together. Darnassus is open to the sky, and the graceful bridges spanning the lake around which it is built set the buildings wide apart. The elegant bridges, beautiful groves, and leaf-covered pathways that dot the city’s landscape are testaments to the night elves’ reverence for nature.

At the center of the city lies the bank of Darnassus, nestled into a huge tree which trunk is shaped like a bear and branches like a bird taking flight from the bear's back. Besides the tree lies the Hero's Call Board, and a few yards away, the Flight Master.}
