As your hyppogryph nears the shores of Lor'danel, you can see the ground as been violently shaken by the Cataclysm. Huge cracks are dotting the landscape as the Night Elves had to build multiple new bridges to be able to walk around the place. As your mount cycle around the town before landing, you realize the water of the shore is filling the cracks in the ground and is actually flowing inward into the continent rather than outward into the see.

The hyppogryph lands near Lor'danel inn as you are greeted by a Priestess of the Moon who was looking over a night elf body inside a tent.
