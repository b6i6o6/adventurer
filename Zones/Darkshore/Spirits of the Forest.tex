\progress{The Final Flame of Bashal'Aran}

\miss{Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea says: Be sure to stop by the bridges southeast of town. You should be able to secure a nightsaber to get you down the ruins.}

Following the advice, you take the bridge out of Lor'danel and approach the Nightsaber Rider at the other end of it.

\miss{You say: I'd like to travel to Bashal'Aran.}

She puts you on one of her nightsabers and instructs it to transport you to Bashal'Aran. The nightsaber follows the road south of Lor'danel until it approaches a ruined area. By the ramp into the ruins are two night elves. One one Nightsaber Rider and another who addresses you as you give the nightsabers reins to the rider.

\start{Solace for the Highborne}

Entering Bashal'Aran, you are greeted by Writhing Highbornes spirits who attack you on sight. You make your way through the ruins until you find The Final Flame of Bashal'Aran, a brazier bathed in an minous blue aura. As you extinguish the flame, you hear a Cursed Highborne yell in the distance, and more spirits coming to fight you.

\miss{Writhing Highborne says: "The cold comes..."}

You continue to fight your way into the ruins until you notice one spirit who is not attacking you. It mist be Anaya Dawnrunner, the decesed wife of Cerellean. Carrying the task he gave you, you attack the spirit and defeat it.

\miss{Anaya Dawnrunner says: Finally, my soul may rest... Oh, dearest Cerellean...}

On the ground where her spirit used to be, you find a pendant which was probably hers. You take it to give it to her husband.

You exit the ruins and return to Arya Automnlight near the entrace, telling her that the deed is done, and that the spirits of Bashal'Aran have been freed.

\complete{Solace for the Highborne}

Before taking your nightsaber back to Lor'danel, you decide to search for Grimclaw, Volcor's companion bear, who disappeared somewhere between the ruins of Auberdine and Lor'danel. On your way south, you notice the area has been damaged even more so than the north of Darkshore, as the road is completely broken by huge cracks in the ground, and some trees are leaning towards the ground as you notice a huge tornado a few miles forward.

From the top of the crack where you are standing, you spot a white bear on the floor to the right, with a Keeper of the Grove and a dryad beside him. You manage to descend in the crack then ascend the other side as you approach the pair and notice that Grimclaw lies injured on the ground.

\miss{Keeper Karithus says: Welcome, child.}

\start{Ritual Materials}

As you can spot Moonstalkers sleeping under some trees near you, you decide to start by gathering the materials for Karithus' ritual.

You approach the sleeping Moonstalkers and quietly pull out a few of hiw whiskers and start running away. \miss{The moonstalker rises, angry at being disturbed}, but you are already far enough that it does not understand what woke it. You spot another group of sleeping Moonstalkers nearby and approach them to take some of their whiskers as well. As you force some of the closes one's hair, \miss{the moonstalker wakes suddenly and lets out a low growl}, waking up the other one. \miss{The moonstalker jumps to its feet, teeth bared.} Surprised, you start to run away, the Moonstalker Whiskers in your hand.

After running a few yards away, the moonstalkers stop chasing you and return to their slumber under the trees. You realize you just entered the stags territory. Hiding behind one of the trees, you wait for the great stag to wander further away from the does. Once the way is clear, you slowly approach the does and pull off a Thuft of Mottled Doe Hair. The doe starts running toward the stag for protection. Fearing the stag's retribution, you jump into the nearby river and stay under water to hide from it.

A moment later, you stick your head out of the water to breathe and you spot some Hungry Thistle Bear trying to fish for salmons. One of them is eating nearby and does not notice you as you approach it from the water. You pull off a bit of the hair from its thick hide but the bear, its attention caught by its delicious meal, does not react at all.

Further along the inwards-flowing river, you notice a naga on a ridge. The serpentine humanoid seems to stand guard at the entrance of the Ruins of Lornesta. You quietly approach the ruins and you spot multiple nagas in the shallow waters. This is probably the Darkscale nagas that Seraphine wants you to kill. You engagne the Darkscale Scouts and benefit from the surprise element, allowing you to kill a few of them easily. Unfortunately, you miss one of them attempting to run away in fear. As he rallies other Darkscale Scouts, you use Seraphine's Petrified Root on the body of the fallen naga, which \miss{raises an Ent from the nourishing remains of a dead Darkscale Scout.}

The group of Darkscale Scouts rallied by the escaping one approaching you way, you charge at the nagas with the Withered Ents on your side. You realize one of the naga in the group is slimmer and has four arms, without a doubt \rare{Lady Vespira}a sorceress. You engage the sorceress as the Withered Ents attack the Scouts. The scouts are quickly dealt with, but the remaining naga casts a Forked Lightning which instantly kills the ents. Using the Petrified Root again, you raise new Withered Ents from the bodies of the scouts and overwhelm the sorceress.

As you start to harvest some of the Fuming Toadstool mushrooms around the ruins for Karithus, you are attacked by yet another group of nagas. These ones are not merely supported by a sorceress, they are lead by her.

\miss{Lady Janira says: We will suffer no interruptions!}
\miss{Lady Janira says: The age of the night elves is coming to a close.}
\miss{Lady Janira says: You live on borrowed time. The sea will consume you.}
\miss{Lady Janira says: Queen Azshara will return and your land will be forfeit.}

Giving all you got, you manage to kill a few Darkscale Scouts and raise some more Withered Ents. With their help, you manage to overthrow Lady Janira. As the ents start running amock killing the remaining nagas fleeing, you harvest a few Fuming Toadstoll.

You make your way back to Keeper Karithus and Seraphine and start retelling the fight you just went through.

In order to race after Grimclaw, you return near the ruins of Bashal'Aran to take a nightsaber ride back to Lor'danel.

\miss{Nightsaber Rider says: I'm glad to see that you're well.}
\miss{Nightsaber Rider says: Looking for a ride?}

You mount the nightsaber as it quickly runs to Lor'danel. Once in town, you give the nightsaber back to the rider in Lor'danel and run to Ranger Glynda to tell her that the final flame of Bashal'Aran has been extinguised.

More murlocs from all around the wreckage rush towards the Foolhardy Adventurer decoy robot.

\miss{Foolhardy Adventurer says:  Detonation imminent.}

The decoy robot exploses, killing all the murlocs.

You make your way back to Lor'danel and the dwarf.

\miss{Nightsaber Rider says: Looking for a ride?}

\miss{You say: I'd like to travel to the ruins of Mathystra.}

She puts you on a nightsaber which starts running to the east. You pass near the tower of Althalaxx. It is in ruins and the trees around it are on fire. Along the way, you notice multiple Shatterspear Raiders corpses.

You reach the Ruins of Mathystra, where a small force of sentinels have set up camp. A few of them are inspecting a troll body. As you approach them, their leader turns to you

Inside the camp you find Shatterspear Armaments stored inside crates marked with the symbol of the Horde. You use the Sentinel Torch to burn the crates.

The fire from the burning alerts the Shatterspear Mystics and other Horde Enforcers also run to your position. You manage to escape being slaughtered by hiding nearby, at the western end of the Shatterspear camp, where you realize the trolls even built some docks for ships.

Once the rumble is over, you make your way to the back of the camp where you notice a night elf body lying on the ground. You kill the Shatterspear Shamans along the way and kneel near the body.

You take the time to burn a few more Shatterspear Armaments crates then jump into the water before the fire bring in more reinforcements again.

You swim back to the nearest shore, where you are attacked by Greymist Tidehunter murlocs. They are pale grey and purple in color, but they seem to be lead by a \rare{Flagglemurk the Cruel}smaller murloc which actually is a colorful one.
