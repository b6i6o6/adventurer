\miss{Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea says: Be sure to stop by the bridges southeast of town. You should be able to secure a nightsaber to get you down the ruins.}

Following the advice, you take the bridge out of Lor'danel and approach the Nightsaber Rider at the other end of it.

% TODO: the rider has multiple quotes !
% \miss{Nightsaber Rider says: I'm glad to see that you're well.}
% \miss{Nightsaber Rider says: Looking for a ride?}

\miss{You say: I'd like to travel to Bashal'Aran.}

She puts you on one of her nightsabers and instructs it to transport you to Bashal'Aran. The nightsaber follows the road south of Lor'danel until it approaches a ruined area. By the ramp into the ruins are two night elves. One one Nightsaber Rider and another who addresses you as you give the nightsabers reins to the rider.

\start{Solace for the Highborne}

Entering Bashal'Aran, you are greeted by Writhing Highbornes spirits who attack you on sight. You make your way through the ruins until you find The Final Flame of Bashal'Aran, a brazier bathed in an minous blue aura. As you extinguish the flame, you hear a Cursed Highborne yell in the distance, and more spirits coming to fight you.

\miss{Writhing Highborne says: "The cold comes..."}

You continue to fight your way into the ruins until you notice one spirit who is not attacking you. It mist be Anaya Dawnrunner, the decesed wife of Cerellean. Carrying the task he gave you, you attack the spirit and defeat it.

\miss{Anaya Dawnrunner says: Finally, my soul may rest... Oh, dearest Cerellean...}

On the ground where her spirit used to be, you find a pendant which was probably hers. You take it to give it to her husband.

You exit the ruins and return to Arya Automnlight near the entrace, telling her that the deed is done, and that the spirits of Bashal'Aran have been freed.

\complete{Solace for the Highborne}

Before taking your nightsaber back to Lor'danel, you decide to search for Grimclaw, Volcor's companion bear, who disappeared somewhere between the ruins of Auberdine and Lor'danel. On your way south, you notice the area has been damaged even more so than the north of Darkshore, as the road is completely broken by huge cracks in the ground, and some trees are leaning towards the ground as you notice a huge tornado a few miles forward.

From the top of the crack where you are standing, you spot a white bear on the floor to the right, with a Keeper of the Grove and a dryad beside him. You manage to descend in the crack then ascend the other side as you approach the pair and notice that Grimclaw lies injured on the ground.

\miss{Keeper Karithus says: Welcome, child.}

% TODO: Continues on with Darkshore2
% For the spirit choice, I can just write a small sentence like "you sense you are more agile" or "you sense you are more resistant, like if the spirit of the bear was protecting you somehow" and the bears/cats/stags of Darkshore now regard you in a friendly manner. Just simple sentences, no page change.
