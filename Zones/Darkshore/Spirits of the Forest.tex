% TODO: Tharnarium quote somewhere !

% For the spirit choice, I can just write a small sentence like "you sense you are more agile" or "you sense you are more resistant, like if the spirit of the bear was protecting you somehow" and the bears/cats/stags of Darkshore now regard you in a friendly manner. Just simple sentences, no page change.
