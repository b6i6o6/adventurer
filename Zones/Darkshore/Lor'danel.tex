Behind you arrives a sentinel mounted on a white hippogryph.

\miss{Lor'danel Sentinel says: Priestesses, I am to bring word that there are more survivors incoming. They are doing everything they can to sift through for the ones that are still alive, please send any help that you can!}

\miss{Dentaria Silverglade says: Understood, Sentinel. Return to the beach and aid them in bringing back any that are still alive.}

\miss{Lor'danel Sentinel says: Of course, Priestess.}
