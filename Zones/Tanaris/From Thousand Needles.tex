\says{38534}{40536}  % The paperwork's ready for you to sign, Marin. My people are just waiting on your decision.
\says{38535}{40537}  % Gosh, Mr. Noggenfogger, I know you wouldn't want to damage your reputation as a neutral trade entity by forming closer ties to the Horde!
\says{38534}{40538}  % This is laughable. You know what it's like trying to do business with gnomes.
\says{38535}{40539}  % Oh, oh, I know this one! It's better than doing business with failed goblins that had to beg others for help!
\says{38534}{40540}  % Why you little irradiated...
\yells{38532}{40541}  % AGH! Enough! You two are driving me INSANE! Start getting some freakin' work done around here or get the heck out of my town!

As you stand there and stare at the trio, your contact in Gadgetzan finally notices you.
