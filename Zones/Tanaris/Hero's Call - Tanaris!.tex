Reaching Gadgetzan, you start looking for Kelsey Steelspark. You find her in the middle of a heated discussion with the Baron of Gadgetzan, and an other goblin from the Bilgewater Cartel.

\says{38534}{40536}  % The paperwork's ready for you to sign, Marin. My people are just waiting on your decision.
\says{38535}{40537}  % Gosh, Mr. Noggenfogger, I know you wouldn't want to damage your reputation as a neutral trade entity by forming closer ties to the Horde!
\says{38534}{40538}  % This is laughable. You know what it's like trying to do business with gnomes.
\says{38535}{40539}  % Oh, oh, I know this one! It's better than doing business with failed goblins that had to beg others for help!
\says{38534}{40540}  % Why you little irradiated...
\yells{38532}{40541}  % AGH! Enough! You two are driving me INSANE! Start getting some freakin' work done around here or get the heck out of my town!

As you stand there and stare at the trio, the gnome finally notices you.

\says{38535}{38521}  % Why hello there, fellow member of the Alliance! As an official representative of Gadgetzan, I'm here to make sure we poor scattered gnomes can peacefully co-exist with the Steamwheedle goblins here in Gadgetzan! We may even be open to tolerating the presence of their new Horde goblin friends. I'm sure we can all come to an agreeable decision with your help!
