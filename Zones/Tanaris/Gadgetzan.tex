\says{38535}{38521}  % Why hello there, fellow member of the Alliance! As an official representative of Gadgetzan, I'm here to make sure we poor scattered gnomes can peacefully co-exist with the Steamwheedle goblins here in Gadgetzan! We may even be open to tolerating the presence of their new Horde goblin friends. I'm sure we can all come to an agreeable decision with your help!

On your way out of the town, a goblin addresses you.

\startID{25112}  % Butcherbot

You exit Gadgetzan towards the coast. You notice Bloodsail pirate ships at the far end of the bay, and some Sea Giants walking in the shallows south, their enormous feet crashing over some supplies crates half submerged by the sea. You enter the shallows and manage to kill a few of the giants. As you start recovering the Steamwheedle Supplies, you are attacked by a Southsea Scoundrel.

\says{40665}{40573}\text{40574}\text{40575}  % That be property 'o the Southsea Freebooters now, landlubber! Ye'll not get around our blockade with scavengin'! The Southsea Freebooters own this shore!

Seems like Gadgetzan has a pirate problem. This one was probably afraid of the Sea Giants and was waiting in hiding for some brave soul to kill the giants for him so he would just need to loot the crates. That could have been a sound strategy, except someone able to take on the giants will have no problem handling with him.

You make short work of the pirate and, as you start heading back to Gadgetzan, you notice some Glasshide Basilisk in the nearby dunes. You kill a few of them then use the Buthcerbot Control Gizmo to \miss{deploy a Butcherbot to harvest parts from a slain animal.}

\says{39696}{39703}\text{39700}  % Increase your profit potential with Butcherbot! No part goes to waste! Yay!

The small robot then starts clawing at the carcass and harvest meat from it, storing it inside a safe compartment of itself.

After you harvested enough of the Glasshide Basilisks, you head back to Gadgetzan, where Driz is waiting for you.

Reassuring Driz about your abilities, you walk back towards Kelsey.

\progressID{25048}  % Seaside Salvage

You show Kelsey the crates you salvaged from the Sea Giants.

\completeID{25048}  % Seaside Salvage

You are not sure why the goblins of Gadgetzan want to recover these supplies because, honestly, it \miss{looks like a bunch of junk.}

\says{38535}{40567}  % There you go, Mister Noggenfogger! You won't have to worry about those giants anymore!

\says{38532}{40568}  % That's actually a load off my plate. Thanks, kid.

\says{38534}{40569}  % Tch. Amateurs.

Kelsey turns back to face you.
