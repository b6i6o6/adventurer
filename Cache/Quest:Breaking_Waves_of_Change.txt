You look able. And perhaps willing to help?€€[[Auberdine]] has finally fallen. Though many of its inhabitants departed long ago when the city first suffered the brunt of the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], many of the more stubborn residents are yet unaccounted for. And it now appears that the city may have been overrun by water elementals.€€My sisters need help rescuing the survivors. Please, <class>, use the western tree to reach Rut'theran, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a flight to Lor'danel. Be swift!€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost|||85}}€€==Completion==€Did the [[sentinels]] send you? Thank [[Elune]]. We need everyone we can get.€€==Notes==€Go through the teleportation tree on the west side of the city, then turn around to find {{NPC||Vesprystus}}, the flight master, at {{co|55.4|88.4|Teldrassil}} just to the east of the other teleportation tree in Rut'theran. He automatically offers the flight path to Lor'danel, which is free, so take it. A few yards from where the hippogryph sets down is Dentaria, also on the landing platform.€€==Progression==€{{Breaking Waves of Change}}€€==Patch changes==€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{elinks-quest|26383}}
