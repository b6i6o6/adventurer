The [[druid]]s in [[Darnassus]] use the water of the [[moonwell]]s of [[Teldrassil]], and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.€€Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of [[Starbreeze Village]] to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. Pay heed to the lessons of the moonwells, lest we find ourselves furthering our shortcomings. €€== Progress ==€Hello again, <name>. Have you completed your task? €€== Completion ==€It is only natural that our race, once immortal and revered, would struggle with regarding ourselves in the humbled manner that we likely should.
