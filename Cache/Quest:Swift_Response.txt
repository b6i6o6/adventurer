I assumed her dead, but it appears that she's been captured. The trolls indicate that they have at least two captives though... the only other person that comes to mind is Alanndarian Nightsong, a civilian that was in the area against my advisement early yesterday.€€The Shatterspear have established a war camp to the north - it is almost certainly where any of their prisoners are being taken. Find them and free them if you're able.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€...€€==Completion==€<Alanndarian looks very pale, though shallow breaths betray the life that remains in her.>€€You're here...  to save me? A bit later... than I hoped. €€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13508}}
