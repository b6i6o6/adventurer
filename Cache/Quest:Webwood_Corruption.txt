I'd hoped that its corruption had been wiped away completely. Something fowl lingers.€€These spiders suffer much more deeply from the corruption than the other nearby wildlife. They are becoming a danger to your people and a danger to the forest. We must thin their numbers, but more importantly, we need to find the source of the corruption that plagues them.€€I will come with you and aid you in this.€€== Rewards ==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: €|Thistlewood Maul€|Thistlewood Dagger€|Thistlewood Staff€|Thistlewood Blade€}}€€You will also receive: {{cost|||75}}€€== Completion ==€This corruption these spiders suffer from is not simply surface deep.
