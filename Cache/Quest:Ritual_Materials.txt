Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating.€€Please do not harm any of them.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|500}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€Have you retrieved the materials that I asked for? And please tell me that you did not harm any of the animals in the process... €€==Completion==€These will do perfectly. These are the final ingredients for an incense I've been working on. I will explain in just a moment, let me mix these in first.€€== Notes ==€If you have one, all the items can be looted while mounted.€€Basically, the animal must be neutral for you to get close, loot it, then get away.  The Hungry Thistle Bears will emote when you can loot, and the Moonstalkers will emote when you should immediately run away.  The bears may be a little tricky at quest level simply because you need to wait close enough without aggroing it.€€* {{text|emote|Hungry Thistle Bear catches a fish!}}€* {{text|emote|The moonstalker rouses from its slumber with a deep growl.}}€* {{text|emote|The moonstalker rises, angry at being disturbed.}}€€==Progression==€{{A Lost Companion}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13566}}
