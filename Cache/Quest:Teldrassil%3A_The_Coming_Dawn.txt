It is directly south of here, on the shores of the [[Pools of Arlithrien]]. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand. I sense a growing corruption from the boughs of southern [[Teldrassil]].€€When you have the water, I want you to bring it to a [[Tarindrella|familiar face]] that you'll see at the pools. She wishes to battle the corruption, and has asked for you personally.€€==Progress==€It is good to see you again, <name>. I see you have succeeded in collecting the waters of the moonwells on behalf of [[Corithras Moonrage]]. I hope you have learned much along the way. €€==Completion==€Indeed, I have spoken to Corithras on my way here, and he has gifted me with the waters you have been gathering. They may well prove useful sooner than we'd imagined.€€Strangely, the growing corruption we've felt is actually a good sign. Teldrassil has been burdened with this taint for a long time, and thanks to the blessing of the [[dragon aspect]]s, only now is it coming to the surface in a form that we might strike against. €€==Gains==€You will receive:€*780 XP (or {{coppercost|480}} at max level)€*250 reputation with [[Darnassus]]€€==Notes==€The [[Shade of the Kaldorei]] appears once again as you approach the moonwell.€:{{text|emote|Shade of the Kaldorei rests on the side of the moonwell in thoughtful contemplation.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|In weeks past, all of those living atop Teldrassil have found their memories blurry, as if [[Stormrage|time itself seized a portion of their lives]].}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|We break from this haze to find that [[Fandral Staghelm]] and many of his closest followers have disappeared without a word.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|But in his place, [[Malfurion Stormrage|Shan'do Stormrage]] awoke from the dream and returned to his beloved Tyrande Whisperwind.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|And with his return came [[Alexstrasza]] and [[Ysera]], to at long last offer their blessings upon Teldrassil.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Though [[Bough of Corruption|a small corruption]] lingers, desperately longing to be cleansed, the boughs of Teldrassil itself seem changed.
