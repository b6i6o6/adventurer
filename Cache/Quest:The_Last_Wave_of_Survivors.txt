They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.€€Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending [[Sentinels]] and [[Hippogryph]]s down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it.€€== Rewards ==€You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}€€== Progress ==€Their pride kept them in Auberdine for this long, but none deserves such a cruel fate.€€== Completion ==€Thank you, <class>. Some of them surely would not have made it without you.€€We'll be taking the wounded to the main building once we have them all safely back in town. Perhaps you can meet us there later?€€== Notes ==€Make sure to grab {{quest|Threat from the Water}} from [[Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea]] at {{co|50.2|19.8|Darkshore}} before leaving [[Lor'danel]].€€Finding [[Volcor]]:€:<Volcor's body lies motionless.
