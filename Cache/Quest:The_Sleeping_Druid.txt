The [[furbolg]] have animated my physical form and are using it to attack anyone that attempts to explore the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]. I am now trapped in the [[Emerald Dream]], powerless to stop this.€€You must help me. The Gnarlpine shaman carry a strange charm which is used to perform this ritual, and I'd like to examine it. Please, <name>, bring one to me.€€==Progress==€If I can examine the charm, I may be able to figure out how to break the enchantment. Have you found one?€€==Completion==€Thank you, <name>.€€What an odd trinket this is...
