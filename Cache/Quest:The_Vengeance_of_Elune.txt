We have an opportunity to strike out and purge the source of the fel moss that has tainted the gnarlpine, the timberlings, and everything else.€€With the water that you've collected from the moonwells and the renewed strength of Teldrassil herself, I can grant you great power for a short while. Put an end to this corruption, <name>.€€("Bough of Corruption: As Malfurion tore the remains of [[Xavius]] from Teldrassil, a great weight was lifted from the dying [[world tree]].  One last remnant of Xavius remains to torment the night elf people, but [[Elune]]'s champion approaches to finally free the tree completely.")€€==Rewards==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: €|Revitalizing Wristguards€|Britches of Turning Fortune€|Uncorrupted Hands€|Durable Drape€|Uncorrupted Gloves€|Trousers of Turning Fortune€}}€€You will also receive: {{cost||7|}}€€==Progress==€Did you find the source of the corruption?€€==Completion==€Elune be praised!€€Everything I had encountered suggested this corruption to be buried deep within Teldrassil itself...
