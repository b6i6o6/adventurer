Still, I could use some salve to close his wounds and lessen his pain while he heals.€€To the east you will find the Ruins of Lornesta. Among the crumbled stones, there is a variety of fuming toadstool that flourishes in the damp environment. Bring me some of the toadstools so that I can mix a salve for our friend here.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|500}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€Grimclaw is quite the fierce combatant. I feel somewhat sorry for those poachers, despite their aims. €€==Completion==€You have my thanks, young one. We should be able to speed Grimclaw's recovery dramatically with this salve.€€==Progression==€{{A Lost Companion}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13598}}
