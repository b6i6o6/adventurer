Have you seen the red-feathered birds swarming around the bones out there? Those are fire rocs. They'll light you up good if you're not careful.€€They're also pretty darn valuable thanks to their unique anatomy. Most of the hunters loafing around here aren't up to the task of killing fire-spitting buzzards for money...think you can handle it?€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|6500}} (+{{coppercost|4200}} at max level)€€==Progress==€I've heard about this [[Nesingwary]] guy, out of [[Stranglethorn Vale]], hunting all sorts of beasts for sport.€€For SPORT.  What a complete idiot, right?  Think of all the profit he's letting rot in the field!€€==Completion==€Alchemists pay through the nose for these things. Sure, maybe I tell some of them they're dragon parts, but that ain't my problem, right? €€==Gains==€*6,900 experience€*250 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]€€==Progression==€{{Gadgetzan story}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|25111}}
