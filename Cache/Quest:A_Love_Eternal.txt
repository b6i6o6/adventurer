I would call myself fortunate, but my beloved, Anaya, lays long dead. I am alone and deeply troubled, and sadly, I require your aid yet again.€€Wandering the woods of Darkshore after my rescue, I found myself in the ruins of Bashal'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved.€€She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed.€€("Anaya Dawnrunner: For some, letting go is the hardest thing they will ever have to do.")€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Forlorn Shield|Restless Leggings}}€€==Progress==€I somehow avoided being inflicted with the same toxin that the other survivors now endure. I cannot help but be envious of them to a degree though... living an eternity alone seems not worth living at all.€€I miss you so much, Anaya. €€==Completion==€Thank you, <name>. Perhaps it would have been better... if I had done it myself. But even after these thousands of years, I could not bear to raise my hand against my beloved.€€Please, I would be alone with my grief...€€== Notes ==€The original cutscene ending will sometimes not happen, but will show up in your chat window; Anaya doesn't appear, Cerellean doesn't react to anyone, nor are there any speech bubbles.€€€''The ghost of Anaya Dawnrunner appears beside Cerellean Whiteclaw.''€: {{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|Anaya...?  Do my eyes deceive me?  Is it really you?}}€: {{text|say|Anaya|The ages have been cruel to you and I, my love, but be assured, it is, and at long last we are reunited.}}€: {{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|That the fates should be so cruel as to permit us only this after a thousand years apart...}}€: {{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|Do you hate me, my love?  That I was forced to destroy your living form, that your spirit be released from unhappy bondage.}}€: {{text|say|Anaya|Let it not trouble your heart, beloved.  You have freed me from slavery, and for that I love you all the more.}}€: {{text|say|Anaya|Sadly, even this must be cut short...  The ties that bind me to this world weaken, and pull me away...}}€: {{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|No!  Anaya... Anaya!  Don't leave me!  Please...}}€: {{text|say|Anaya|Farewell, Cerellean, until we are joined once again...}}€''The ghost fades away.''€: {{text|emote|Anaya's soft voice trails away into the mists, "Know that I love you always..."}}€: {{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|How, my love?  How will I find the strength to face the ages of the world without you by my side...}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13563}}
