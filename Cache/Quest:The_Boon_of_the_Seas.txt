You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further.€€Like Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me?€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|350}} (+{{coppercost|510}} at max level)€{{itembox|You will also receive:€|Diver's Cord}}€€==Progress==€Did you bring muscles from the clams? I worry that our time grows very short. €€==Completion==€This will do perfectly. Thank you so much!€€I suspect they will want to thank you personally should they recover, so perhaps you can stop by later on.€€== Notes ==€On acceptance:€:{{text|say|Serendia Oakwhisper|When the wounded arrive, we will be putting them up in the Inn while we tend to their recovery.
