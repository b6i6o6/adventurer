Do you have news concerning the timberlings?€€== Completion ==€You found this on [[Teldrassil]]?  Intriguing... this fruit is exotic.  Perhaps its seeds were brought here from far off.  Perhaps even as far as [[Azeroth (continent)|Azeroth]]!  And there's something about this fruit... it seems to have reacted very strangely with the soil of Teldrassil.€€Thank you, <name>.
