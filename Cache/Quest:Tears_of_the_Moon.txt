Graceful and pure, the spider spun her silver threads through the moonlight, catching the evening mist. The silvery dew had strong healing powers and was kept at the nearby temple.€€But of late, Sathrah has descended into madness. Her future generations are now threatened as well.€€Find Lady Sathrah, <name>, and end her suffering. She dwells northeast of here, near the river. Gather her silvery spinnerets and bring them back to me. €€("Lady Sathrah: Corruption and madness can consume even the purest of Elune's creatures.  It falls to us to bring peace to those that deserve it most.")€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost||10}}€€==Progress==€I regret the task that I have asked you to carry out; but Lady Sathrah is beyond hope.€€It is our hope to offer the sacrifice of the spinnerets to Elune. With this sacrifice, Elune will bless Sathrah so that she might be reborn, and at peace.€€== Completion ==€The forest mourns for Lady Sathrah, but it was something that had to be done. I hope now that she can rest in peace.€€Thank you, <name>.€€==Progression==€{{Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei}}€€==Patch changes==€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Updated for Cataclysm.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{elinks-quest|2518}}
