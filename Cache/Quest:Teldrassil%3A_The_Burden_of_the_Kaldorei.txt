The first and most powerful of our wells, its waters are said to possess the very essence of [[Elune]]'s Powers{{sic}}.€€Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete.€€==Progress==€To be in the presence of the Oracle Tree... it is almost to feel wisdom take form. €€==Completion==€Along with the [[druid]]s, the Oracle Tree has been carefully monitoring the growth of Teldrassil. Our observations have been disheartening, but all is not without hope.€€The tree is indeed recovering since it's blessing, but the growth is still somehow stunted... hindered.€€We suspect some portion of the corruption remains within the tree, waiting to be cleansed. We simply need to find it. €€==Gains==€You will receive:€*780 XP (or {{coppercost|480}} at max level)€*150 reputation with [[Darnassus]]€€==Notes==€When in the Oracle Glade, pick up the two optional quests: [[Quest:The Enchanted Glade]] and [[Quest:Tears of the Moon]].€€The moonwell is at {{coords|40|29|Teldrassil}}. As you approach it, the {{NPC||Shade of the Kaldorei}} will spawn to continue his story.€€:{{text|emote|Shade of the Kaldorei approaches the moonwell slowly, a familiar, thoughtful look upon its face.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei says: Over time, Staghelm only grew more disconnected from our people.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei says: Some pose that he blames us, his people, for the loss of his son, long ago during the War of the Shifting Sands.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei says: Others cite rumors of his escalating conflicts with Tyrande Whisperwind, the shining light of our people, our leader in Darnassus.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei says: But many druids of the Cenarion Circle stand firm that he wants only what is best for all of the Kaldorei, and serve him unerringly towards that end.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei says: Fandral Staghelm carries the burden of our sins and our follies, and in so doing deserves the respect of us all.}}€:{{text|emote|The Shade of the Kaldorei closes its eyes and fades away.}}€€==Progression==€{{Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|7383}}
