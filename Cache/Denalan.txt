He is a herbalist that works on curing the new world tree, and dealing with the raging timberling situation. He has a small tent and a row of plants. Occasionally, a small group of mini-timberlings, with the color scheme of greater ones (blue-green) will spawn next to him. They are only level 2-3 though, and are easily dispatched.€€==Quests==€* [[Quest:Denalan's Earth]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:Oakenscowl]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Planting the Heart]] {{queststart}}€* [[Quest:Rellian Greenspyre]] {{queststart}}€* [[Quest:The Glowing Fruit]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:The Moss-twined Heart]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:The Shimmering Frond]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:Timberling Seeds]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Timberling Sprouts]] {{queststartfinish}}€€==Quotes==€The creation of Teldrassil was a grand achievement, but now the world must shift to regain it's balance.€€==See also==€*[[List of Teldrassil NPCs]]€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-NPC|2080}}€€[[Category:Night elf characters]]€[[Category:Quest givers]]€[[Category:Teldrassil NPCs]]€€[[es:Denalan]]
