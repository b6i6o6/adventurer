The camp is guarded by some of their mystics, but I've started receiving reports that there are sightings of orcs and tauren there as well.€€I don't want to make any assumptions as to what that suggests, but I do want you to go in and kill them before they can make any further strikes on our Sentinels.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Cover of Leaves|Tysha's Chestguard}}€€==Progress==€Have you finished the deed?€€==Completion==€Excellent work.
