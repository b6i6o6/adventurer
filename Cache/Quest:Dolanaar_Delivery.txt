Can you offer me aid? I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of [[Dolanaar]]. But I still have business with the druids of [[Shadowglen]] and cannot yet leave.€€Can you deliver this package for me? It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn. It lies along the road, to the south.€€== Rewards ==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|q1=5|Darnassian Bleu 	€|q2=5|Refreshing Spring Water}}€You will also receive: {{cost|||25}}€€== Progress ==€How might I be of service to you, young one?  Are you here to rest in the inn?  Do you require a hearthstone?€€== Completion ==€Ah yes, the delivery of herbs from Shadowglen. It is a shame Porthannius could not bring it himself, for we have much to discuss, he and I. But I am glad to get the herbs nonetheless, and I am glad you came.€€While you are here, please, rest yourself. Heroes must keep their strength and spirits high, and must find rest and solace whenever they may. For to neglect one's peace of body and mind is a sure path to failure.€€So... rest.€€==Progression==€{{:Night elf starting experience}}€€== External links ==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|2159}}
