You must travel back down to Rut'theran Village, where we first arrived, and speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel.€€Once in Lor'danel, aid the [[night elf|night elves]] in any way that you are able. I am trusting you to treat them with the reverence that they deserve in light of all that they have done for us.€€I must travel to the distant city of [[Stormwind]] to meet with {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn||King Anduin}}. I hope to see your face again very soon, <name>. Until then, a fond farewell.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost|||85}}€€==Completion==€Our allies have come to our aid? Thank [[Elune]]. [[Tyrande]] was wise to extend open arms to your people.€€We need help. We need everyone we can get.€€==Notes==€Back through the teleportation tree on the west side of the city, then turn around to find {{NPC||Vesprystus}}, the flight master, at {{co|55.4|88.4|Teldrassil}} just to the east of the other teleportation tree in Rut'theran. He automatically offers the flight path to Lor'danel, which is free, so take it. A few yards from where the hippogryph sets down is Dentaria, also on the landing platform.€€==Progression==€{{Breaking Waves of Change}}€€==Patch changes==€* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Updated to reflect that Anduin is the new king.}}€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|26385}}
