We need able bodies as fast as possible.

We only caught word that they were coming within the last hour. I wish that we had more warning...€€The coastline west of us is swarming with vile spray, vicious little [[water elemental]]s. We need to clear them out if any of the survivors are to have a chance of making it to [[Lor'danel]]. Depart immediately and kill every elemental you see.€€== Progress ==€Have you cleared the coast?€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|350}} (+{{coppercost|510}} at max level)€€==Completion==€Your efforts are very much appreciated. Since the Cataclysm, the elementals have been out of control. We have little hope of taking back Auberdine without extinguishing their presence first. €€==Progression==€{{Breaking Waves of Change}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13522}}
