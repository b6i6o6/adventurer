In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree.€€So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings are, particularly considering that things should be healing.€€I want to help hunt down the source. I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds. Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me?€€==Progress==€Do you have the seeds?  I am eager to plant them.€€==Completion==€You got them. This is good! I'm hoping that careful study might lead me to understand where the timberling corruption stems from.€€I will plant these seeds in special soil I have prepared.  I believe the seeds will sprout into timberlings who are much more docile.€€Perhaps later you can see the results!€€== Rewards ==€You will receive: {{cost||3|}}€€[[Forest Mushroom Cap]] (10)€€== Notes ==€You will need one inventory spot open to retrieve [[Timberling Seed]]s, which are required to complete this quest. Timberling Seeds will be randomly dropped by the [[Timberling]]s around [[Lake Al'Ameth]].€€==Progression==€{{A Troubling Breeze}}€€==External links==€{{elinks-quest|918}}
