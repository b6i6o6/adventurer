Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him.€€Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from [[Aldrassil]] out of [[Shadowglen]], and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west.€€Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late.€€== Rewards ==€You will receive: {{cost||1}}€€== Progress ==€Greetings, <class>. For what purpose do I owe the pleasure of our meeting?€€== Completion ==€Ah, I see. You were sent by Tenaron. Well then, it would seem we have much to talk about, much to do.€€Before we get to the task at hand, you should take in the lesson of this moonwell.€€== Transcript ==€After completion:€:{{text|emote|Shade of the Kaldorei smiles at you knowingly as it approaches.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|With [[Malfurion Stormrage]] gone, the druids were left in disarray and in desperate need of a new leader.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Arch Druid [[Fandral Staghelm]] roused the druids and convinced the [[Circle of Ancients]] in [[Darkshore]] that it was time for our people to rebuild.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|In an effort to regain immortality for our people, and with the approval of the Circle, Staghelm and the most powerful druids grew Teldrassil, upon whose boughs you now stand.}}€:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Though we have our new home, our immortal lives have not been restored.}}€:{{text|emote|The Shade of the Kaldorei closes its eyes and fades away.}}€€== Notes ==€After arriving in Dolanaar, pick up the quests {{quest|Reminders of Home}}, {{quest|A Troubling Breeze}} and {{quest|The Emerald Dreamcatcher}}. The chain continues with {{quest|Teldrassil: The Refusal of the Aspects}}.€€The quickest way down is by jumping off the tree. Upon accepting the quest, Tenaron will cast a "Wind's Embrace" buff on you, slowing your fall speed. This will likely earn you the [[Going Down?]] achievement.€€==Progression==€{{:Night elf starting experience}}€€== Patch changes ==€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€== External links ==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|28731}}
