I am Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to train young <class>s like you and to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.€€The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber numbers grew too large, and they will devastate the other populations if they are not culled.€€Journey forth, young <class>, and thin saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved.€€==Rewards==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Glen Culler's Grips€|Archery Training Gloves€|Stemleaf Bracers}}€You will also receive: {{cost|||35}}€€==Progress==€There is still work to be done, <name>. Return to me once you have thinned the nightsaber population.€€==Completion==€You performed your duties well, <name>.€€==Notes==€Like most of the night elf starting zone, this quest was mostly untouched by the Cataclysm. The only real change was that you previously had to kill boars as well as cats.€€When you turn it in, [[Ilthalaine]] will converse with [[Huntress Sandrya Moonfall]] and [[Dentaria Silverglade]].€€:{{text|say|Ilthalaine|I'm sorry, Huntress. None of our new <class>s are ready. They still have much to learn.}}€:{{text|say|Huntress Sandrya Moonfall|I fear time may not be on our side, Ilthalaine. The battle may carry to Teldrassil itself if we do not act soon.}}€:{{text|say|Dentaria Silverglade|We will leave you to your training, Ilthalaine. This is your area of expertise.}}€:{{text|say|Dentaria Silverglade|Study well, <name>. We may need you fighting by our side before the next moon fills.}}€€==Progression==€{{:Night elf starting experience}}€€==Patch changes==€* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Glen Culler's Grips]] added as a reward.}}€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|28713}}
