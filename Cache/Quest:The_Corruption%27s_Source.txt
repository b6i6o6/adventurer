Some lines must never be crossed, and Zenn has crossed several of them.")€==Description==€I rushed here as soon as I heard the news from [[Wizbang Cranktoggle|Wizbang]]. I know who's behind this mess now. Zenn Foulhoof.€€He came over from [[Teldrassil]] after he was chased out for performing perverse magics. The kinds of corruption he employs are not welcome among my people, and it seems he's taken it a step further this time, perhaps as some form of revenge.€€Zenn's been given too many chances, it's time we remove this threat to all that is natural. Kill Zenn and his minions, and then find me back in [[Lor'danel]].€€==Rewards==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Goat Hide Vest 	€|Woven Mail Leggings€|Satyr Horn Staff€}}€€You will also receive: {{cost||4}}€*880 [[XP]]€*250 reputation with [[Darnassus]]€€==Progress==€This is never desirable work.  Zenn was not always the corrupt being that you now see.  Sadly, he is behind reproach at this point.  Much of the damage that he has done to nature is irreversible.€€==Completion==€It is done then. Thank you. I only hope that the wildlife here will see more peace with his passing.€€==Progression==€{{Breaking Waves of Change}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13529}}
