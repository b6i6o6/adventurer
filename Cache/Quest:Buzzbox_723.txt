It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now.€€Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€<Buzzbox 723 hums at you expectantly.> €€==Completion==€<Static precedes Wizbang's distorted voice.>€€The results are coming in now. We should have some information on how the bears contracted this in just a moment. €€==Progression==€{{Buzzbox 413}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13528}}
