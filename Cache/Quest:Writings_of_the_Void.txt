You haven't shown them to anyone else, have you?€€I apologize. You took me off guard. Telarius was a very powerful Demon Hunter, but he was slain during a confrontation with the warden, Maeiv, many years ago. You are fortunate that his ghost was only a shade of his former power. I wonder how many have found their way to him in those ruins.€€I will see to it that these scrolls make their way to the high priestess immediately.
