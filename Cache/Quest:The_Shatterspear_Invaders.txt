I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the [[Tower of Althalaxx]].€€We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand.€€''On accept:''€: {{text|say|Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea|Don't forget to check near the bridges southeast of town for a ride up to our forward post.}}€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost||4}}€*680 [[XP]]€*150 reputation with [[Darnassus]]€€==Completion==€Glynda sent you to lend a hand, did she?
