It becomes available by killing [[Rit'ko]] for [[Quest:One Bitter Wish]], then looting the [[Shatterspear Torturer's Cage Key]] from him to open the Shatterspear Cage holding Aynasha.€€However, the cage is bugged and will remain open if the quest fails.  Aynasha will not offer the quest if you can't interact with the cage, and the only solution is to wait for dailies to reset.€€Another solution would be to use the [[Group Finder]] to look for a server where the cage is closed. This quest can be accepted while in a [[raid]].€€==Objectives==€Escort Sentinel Aynasha to safety.€€* Escort Sentinel Aynasha to the Dock€€==Description==€{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Thanks for the rescue.  Let's get out of here!}}€€It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what [[Alanndarian Nightsong|Alanndarian]] did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.€€I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield.  [[Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze|Morra]] needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.€€Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to [[Lor'danel]] via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel.€€==Rewards==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: €|Aynasha's Spare Sword€|Morra's Gloves€}}€€You will also receive: {{coppercost|600}}€€==Progress==€News from Aynasha?€€€Escorted to the dock and [[Luk'gar]] killed:€: ''Aynasha turns to you.''€: {{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Thanks for getting me out of there.  I should be able to swim back from here, but before I go, one quick thing...}}€: {{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|I was afforded a brief chance to attack their leader, and he was protected by some kind of magic.  Make sure Morra hears of this before leading any kind of attack.}}€: {{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Farewell newcomer.  May [[Elune]]'s blessing be with you.}}€: ''Aynasha leaps off the dock and starts swimming for Lor'danel, despawning.''€€==Completion==€Some sort of shield you say?  We might have a way around that.  [[Balthule Shadowstrike|Balthule]] had an idea for breaking whatever protective enchantments their shaman had, so it might work on this too.  Thank you for saving Aynasha and bringing me this information - it may well make the difference in our battle.€€== Gains ==€* 910 [[XP]]€* +250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13510}}
