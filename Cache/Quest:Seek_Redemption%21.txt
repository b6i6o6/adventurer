In this quest, players are sent by a member of the Council of the Forest to redeem themselves for doing the bidding of the evil satyr, [[Zenn Foulhoof]].€€== Objectives ==€Collect 3 [[Fel Cone]]s and give them to [[Zenn Foulhoof]] outside of [[Dolanaar]].€* [[Fel Cone]] x3€€== Description ==€The [[Council of the Forest]] has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The [[satyr]] is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures.€€You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of [[Teldrassil]].€€Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. [[Fel Cone]]s are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke.€€Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack.€€== Reward ==€You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}€€==Progress==€What do you have for me, <name>? A lovely snack I presume?€€==Completion==€Ah, what a sweet <race>! I knew you would come in handy!€€== Notes ==€Declining or abandoning this quest does not spoil your reputation.€€* [[Syral Bladeleaf]] {{co|56.1|57.7|Teldrassil}} can be found just outside the northern building of [[Dolanaar]].€* [[Sentinel Shayla Nightbreeze]] can be found patrolling the road west of Dolanaar.€* [[Sentinel Kyra Starsong]] can be found inside the Dolanaar inn.€Speak with any of them to receive this quest.€€[[Fel Cone]]s are found beneath the trees of [[Teldrassil]]. You can search for them as you do other quests, or simply wait for the ones near Zenn to respawn, as they are on a very short respawn timer.€€Once you feed him the cones, he will turn into a frog.€€:{{text|say|Zenn Foulhoof|Ribbit!
