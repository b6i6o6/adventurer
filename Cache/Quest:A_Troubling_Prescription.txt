It looks as though the Forsaken have also been studying Foulhoof's handiwork. You grab the most important-looking notes and prepare to smash the laboratory before notifying Treetender of your discovery.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€What's this? You found something else in the cave? €€==Completion==€<Tharnariun Treetender pages through the notes as you relate your story, the lines in his face deepening with concern.>€€So the Forsaken have been studying Foulhoof's work? My gut crawls at the thought of what they might have done were they able to weaponize his corruption. You've done well to destroy their work, but this raises deeper concerns. What brought the Forsaken to our doorstep? Are they working with the Shatterspear trolls to our north? Sorrows are heaping upon sorrows, <class>. I'm glad you're here.€€==Progression==€{{Breaking Waves of Change}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13831}}
