Corrupted [[furbolg]]s from the [[Gnarlpine]] tribe have been attacking travelers relentlessly.€€Important news and commerce travels to and from Darnassus by way of this road daily. We cannot afford to have a rogue band of heathens terrorizing people.€€Take up arms in the name of the sacred forest, <class>. Their den lies up this northern path. Slay these Gnarlpine ambushers and report back to me. €€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}€€==Progress==€The road is still not safe, <class>. Travel forth and slay the Gnarlpine ambushers and return to me.€€==Completion==€You have served the good people of [[Dolanaar]] and Darnassus well, brave <class>.  As a member of the Sentinel force of Teldrassil, I salute your efforts. €€== Notes ==€The quest originally referred to Amara as "Sentinel Amara Nightwalker".€{{speculation}}€While possibly a mix up during quest design alongside NPC creation, "Amara Nightwalker" may be her full name; other moon priestesses in the game only list a first name.  A possible in-game explanation could be that she started out as a Sentinel, and later finished her training as a [[Priestess of the moon]], becoming a leader among the Sentinels as well.€€==External links==€{{elinks-quest|487}}
