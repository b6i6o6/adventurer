In this quest, players are sent by [[Gaerolas Talvethren]] to [[Athridas Bearmantle]] with a desperate report regarding the furbolgs of [[Starbreeze Village]].€€==Objectives==€Return to [[Athridas Bearmantle]] in [[Dolanaar]].€€==Description==€The Gnarlpine tribe has been corrupted!€€The once peaceful furbolgs have turned against the protectors of the forest. They ambushed me as I left for the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]] and proceeded to pillage [[Starbreeze Village]]. [[Ursal the Mauler]], their chieftain, is using the evil powers of the Fel Moss to drive them mad.€€I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news. The task is left to you, young <class>. We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet!€€==Rewards==€You will receive {{cost||1|25}}€€==Completion==€By the stars! This is quite disturbing indeed!€€We've had troubles in the past with the corruption of the furbolgs, but such troubles should be long past since the cleansing of Teldrassil. I fear for all our people if the blessings of the aspects themselves cannot redeem our great tree. €€==Notes==€=== Obtaining this quest ===€You must have completed [[Quest:A Troubling Breeze]] to obtain this quest.
