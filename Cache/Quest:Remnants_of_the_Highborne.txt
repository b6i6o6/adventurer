Out of mild courtesy for their cursed souls, we haven't been overly proactive about stripping the ruins of artifacts, but those hesitancies vanish in light of this new troll threat.€€While you're aiding the Sentinels in their goals within the ruins, please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them back to me. I would like to preserve what little I can.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€Were you able to recover any artifacts?€€==Completion==€Perfect!  Thank you so much.  I would hate to lose more records of our culture to war - far too much has been sacrificed already.€€==Quest Chain==€On completing {{quest|Shatterspear Laborers}} and {{quest|Remnants of the Highborne}}, two new quests become available:€* [[Quest:War Supplies]]€* [[Quest:Denying Manpower]]€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13505}}
