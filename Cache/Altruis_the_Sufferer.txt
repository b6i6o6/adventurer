He ultimately left the Betrayer's service when he decided that Illidan had become the very thing he was sworn to fight, making camp in western [[Nagrand]] with his [[nether drake]] mount, [[Nethrandamus]], and making plans against the [[Burning Legion]] encampments there. [[Akama]] admired Altruis for opposing the direction Illidan was taking.<ref>[[Quest:Champion: Akama]]</ref> He was eventually captured by the night elf [[Warden]]s, who imprisoned him along with the other demon hunters in the [[Vault of the Wardens]]. Freed during the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion]] and although reconciled with his [[Illidari]] brethren, Altruis still does not condone Illidan's methods and wants new leadership for the Illidari.€€==History==€===The Burning Crusade===€{{Bc-section}}€====The Forge Camps====€[[Huntress Kima]] noticed a being riding atop a [[nether drake]] who arrived in [[Telaar]] a week before interacting with the adventurer. That being introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask several questions about [[Nagrand]]. He claimed that he was hunting [[Legion]], that such insanity was actually his job. Kima asked the adventurer if they could imagine a person that would willingly hunt [[demon]]s. Before he left, Altruis asked Kima that they let the would-be [[Adventurer|heroes]] in town know that he would be staying in western [[Nagrand]] for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him. The adventurer thus went and did so. Altruis first asked them if his appearance startled them, and if they knew what he was.<ref>[[Quest:He Called Himself Altruis...]]</ref> He then asked them what they saw when they looked to the west, to which they answered twisted steel and smell sundered earth.€€Altruis said that he saw a precursor to invasion. He thought that his master [[Illidan Stormrage]] was indeed wise in sealing the portals, but that he had since lost his focus. The Legion was seizing opportunity, they seeped out, and grew in number day by day. Altruis explained that he could see demons as clearly as the adventurer could see their own hand in front of their face, and that under normal circumstances, he was able to sense the presence of a demon from a thousand paces. But now, they eluded him, he could not see past their defenses, as they had put in place wards to prevent detection. He believed that the demons feared them because they knew that they feared nothing. The cost for such power was great, and the sacrifices many.<ref>Gossip text</ref>€€Turning to the adventurer, Altruis claimed that they had to stop them before the [[Forge site|forge camps]] that littered the landscape were able to complete whatever it was that they were building. As the Legion's [[mo'arg]] and [[gan'arg]] built weapons of mass destruction at these mobile forges, Altruis said the adventurer would be his eyes, and their weapons his fury.<ref>Gossip text</ref>€€[[File:Survey the Land TCG.jpg|thumb|right|The adventurer riding [[Nethrandamus]] and surveying the lands.]]€But to be his eyes would require some diligence on the adventurer's part. [[Nethrandamus]], his nether drake, would take them through the [[Burning Legion]] camps, but they had to catalog everything that they'd see. Even the smallest detail that they may think to be inconsequential could be useful for their purposes. Primarily, Altruis wanted them to note what structures were in the camps and what comprised the camps' defenses. Nethrandamus would also keep them safe from harm. The adventurer thus rode the nether drake and, the survey complete, returned to Altruis. From the information that the adventurer collected, Altruis found that there were two primary camps: [[Forge Camp: Hate]], directly west of where they stood and [[Forge Camp: Fear]], directly southwest. Each camp had a Legion transporter, one forge, and several spell warding towers. Additionally, the camps were guarded by [[wrathguard]]s manning [[fel cannon]]s. Lastly, each camp had an overseer. They now had a point from which they could plan their counter-attack.<ref>[[Quest:Survey the Land]]</ref>€€As long as the transporters stood, nothing they could do to the forge camps would have any permanence, explained Altruis. They had to find a way to destroy the Legion structures. While Altruis devised a plan of attack, the adventurer kept their engineers and tinkerers busy, greatly slowing down their progress, and buying him the time he needed. Altruis advised the adventurer to stay as far away as possible from the overseers, as they were extremely dangerous beings, before the bravo hero went and killed many demons. The demon hunter eventually figured that there was no conventional means of destroying fel steel.<ref>[[Quest:Buying Time]]</ref>€€However, all forge camps had a master planner. The master planner dictated what types of structures were present at a forge camp and how each structure was situated. Moreover, this information was kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carried around on their person. They needed the master planner's blueprints. Armed with such exacting information, Altruis could persuade an acquaintance of his to lend some assistance. The adventurer thus found the [[mo'arg]] master planner stationed behind the forges and took his blueprints.<ref>[[Quest:The Master Planner]]</ref> The blueprints were then taken to the Lower City of [[Shattrath]], where a mo'arg by the name of [[Sal'salabim]] dwelled. He would probably be at the bar, thought Altruis, drinking away his sorrows. The adventurer had to convince him to lend his assistance, first with patience and understanding, and eventually with fists if that first approach didn't work.<ref>[[Quest:Patience and Understanding]]</ref>€€Sal'salabim agreed to help the adventurer, and he recognized his own design. Pointing at the architecture and formations on the blueprints, he asked them to look at the towers. But before going further, the mo'arg demanded that they helped him first. Giving the adventurer a ledger, Sal'salabim explained that the creatures described inside owed him a lot of gold. The adventurer thus went to collect Raliq's, Coosh'coosh's and Floon's debt.<ref>[[Quest:Crackin' Some Skulls]]</ref> The task done, Sal'salabim pointed out the fel cannons on the blueprints. Drawing an arrow denoting a change of direction, he explained that they could turn the cannons around and use them on the Legion's own structures, but more importantly, that each Overseer had a key to a cannon.<ref>[[Quest:It's Just That Easy?]]</ref> Returning to Altruis, the adventurer was told to proceed and destroy the two Forge Camps, [[Forge Camp: Hate|Hate]] and [[Forge Camp: Fear|Fear]], effectively halting the Legion's advances in [[Nagrand]].<ref>[[Quest:Forge Camp: Annihilated]]</ref>€€===Legion===€{{Legion-section}}€Altruis is one of two characters the [[Adventurer|Slayer]] of the [[Illidari]] can choose to be their second-in-command, the other being [[Kayn Sunfury]], whose ideals and plans for the Illidari are incompatible with Altruis' own. If the player chooses Altruis as their second-in-command, they later go on to recruit [[Akama]].€€Altruis sent [[Kor'vas Bloodthorn]] to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at [[Krasus' Landing]]. To find the [[Twinblades of the Deceiver]], he and the demon hunter went to the entrance of the [[Violet Hold]] guarded by [[Warden Alturas]] to not permit anyone to enter the prison. By Khadgar's trust, [[Warden Alturas]] had no choice but to let them in. He told them that the [[Kirin Tor]] will not be responsible of any sacrifices taken. Altruis stood guard to let the demon hunter confront a eredar named [[Taldath the Destroyer]] to get answers of where [[Varedis Felsoul]] is. Eventually, the demon spilled out the information without warning and Altruis told the demon hunter to finish him off. Learning that [[Felsoul Hold]] in [[Suramar]] is where he and the artifact is at and Altruis got a bat ready for the demon hunter. [[Lyana Darksorrow]] and [[Illysanna Ravencrest]] were to accompany the demon hunter regardless of the outcome. Altruis warns the demon hunter that Varedis is a cunning adversary. Upon arriving at Felsoul Hold, the demons spotted the bats and Altruis told them to fly to a landing site quickly. Losing both Darksorrow and Ravencrest, the demon hunter leaped into the fray and punish them for their hubris.€€Altruis sent Kor'vas Bloodthorn to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at [[Krasus' Landing]]. To find the [[Aldrachi Warblades]], he said that [[Archmage Khadgar]] had something called a [[Crystallized Soul]]. He stressed that the Warblades could tip [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|the war]] in their favor.€€Upon returning to the prison world of [[Mardum, the Shattered Abyss|Mardum]] to make it their new home, Altruis addresses to the Illidari of the accomplishments of the demon hunter by obtaining the artifact. With the ''[[Fel Hammer]]'' in their control, they can plan out every aspect of their assault on the [[Broken Isles]].€€Altruis was met by the adventurer and Khadgar at [[Illidari Stand]] in [[Azsuna]]. Surprised and really impressed of the artifact the champion wielded, he told them to assist Allari and Jace as best they can to maintain ground against the demons there. He instructed the champion, [[Cyana Nightglaive]], and Kor'vas Bloodthorn to attack from within the legion camp ahead. Unfortunately Cyana betrayed them to Legion and the Illidari were swift to put her down. Her death was a blow for the Illidari cannot afford to lose even a single demon hunter in their ranks. Under Khadgar's direction Altruis directed adventurer to meet up with the [[blue dragon]]s that live [[Azurewing Repose|nearby]] citing they can be prove to be a powerful ally in the war against the Burning Legion.€€Altruis was the first to become the champion's cause in their campaign. After collecting essences to communicate with their master, it was time to seek out other allies. Seeking the aid of [[Akama]] the Illidari sneak into the [[Black Temple]]. Though initially hostile to the Illidari Akama is convinced to rejoin the fold as he had admired Altruis for opposing Illidan.<ref>[[Quest:Champion: Akama]]</ref> The ''Fel Hammer'' then jumped to the Legion world of [[Niskara]] to take out the [[Caria Felsoul|Fel]][[Varedis Felsoul|soul]] siblings. With their mission successful, he gave one of the highest honors to the demon hunter and declared them the Slayer and told them that their artifact can awaking great potential when the time came.€€Altruis participated in the [[Battle for the Exodar]] battling against [[High General Rakeesh]], alongside [[Asha Ravensong]].€€[[File:Kayn Altruis together.jpg|thumb|Both Altruis and Kayn together on the ''Fel Hammer''.]]€Altruis and Kayn were both aboard the ''[[Fel Hammer]]'' when the Slayer obtained the [[Slayer's Felbroken Shrieker]].<ref>[[Quest:To Fel and Back]]</ref>€€==Locations==€{{Npchealth|align=left€ | loc1 = Nagrand€ | level1 = 70€ | health1 = 6,600€ | loc2 = Vault of the Wardens€ | level2 = 100€ | health2 = 978,540€ | loc3 = Fel Hammer€ | level3 = 100€ | health3 = 3,365,231€ | loc4 = Azsuna€ | level4 = 100€ | health4 = 2,991,320€ | loc5 = Niskara€ | level5 = 110€ | health5 = 10,392,670€ | loc6 = The Exodar€ | level6 = 101€ | health6 = 660,376€}} €{{clr}}€€==Quests==€{{bc-section}}€;Forge Camp quest chain€* [[Quest:He Called Himself Altruis...]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:Survey the Land]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Buying Time]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:The Master Planner]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Patience and Understanding]] {{queststart}}€* [[Quest:It's Just That Easy?]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:Forge Camp: Annihilated]] {{queststartfinish}}€€;Karabor Training Grounds quest chain€* [[Quest:Altruis]] {{questfinish}}€* [[Quest:Against All Odds]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Against the Illidari]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Against the Legion]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Illidan's Pupil]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:The Book of Fel Names]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Return to the Aldor]] or [[Quest:Return to the Scryers]] {{queststart}}€€{{legion-section}}€{{Stub-section}}€*[[Quest:One More Thing...
