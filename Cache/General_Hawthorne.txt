During the attack he ordered his men to leave a gap open in the line so the citizens of Taurajo may escape, and despite this many [[Yonada|civilian]] [[Krulmoo Fullmoon|casualties]] did occur. Hawthorne also [[Quest:Flightmare|ordered]] Wildhammer mercenaries to firebomb the village.  Following this there are those in the [[Horde]] that refers to Hawthorne as the "The Butcher of Taurajo" due to his actions killing many civillians.€€There are those that ended up in his ranks who are non-violent criminals recruited from the [[Stormwind Stockades]], following Alliance policy.  He discovered that some had broke ranks to loot the ruins, which among other things, he considered disrespectful.  He had an adventurer arrest several; others witnessed this and crawled back to him, requesting clemency.  He had them thrown into the brig at [[Northwatch Hold]] to let them stew for a bit.<ref>[[Quest:Clap 'Em In Irons]]</ref>€€After some initial interactions with the [[adventurer]], he sends them off to [[Fort Triumph]] and says he will travel there himself separately. After this, he is killed in the Horde quest [[Quest:The Butcher of Taurajo|The Butcher of Taurajo]]. His corpse was later retrieved and is found in [[Fort Triumph]], being mourned by his widowed wife, [[Clarice Hawthorne]].€€For his own part, High Chieftain [[Baine Bloodhoof]] accepted that Camp Taurajo was a legitimate military target, as they did train [[hunter]]s and [[warrior]]s there, and knew that Hawthorne refused to have its civilians slaughtered.<ref>''[[Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War]]'', pg. 82</ref>€€==Quests==€* [[Quest:A Line in the Dirt (Alliance)]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Clap 'Em In Irons]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Fields of Blood]] {{queststartfinish}}€* [[Quest:Meet Me at Triumph]] {{queststart}}€€==Objective of==€* [[Quest:The Butcher of Taurajo]]€€==Gossip text==€:What is your name, <class>? <name>?€:Welcome to the Barrens. You are standing at the vanguard of our most important operations on [[Kalimdor|this continent]]. I would be honored if you were to lend us your strength.€€''{{gossip|Tell me what happened at Taurajo.}}''€€:Ah yes, our assault on the Horde town of Taurajo. I struggled with the implications of the decision.€€:Taurajo was admittedly what you might call a 'soft target,' primarily a hunters' camp. Still, it had been used to recruit, equip, and train Horde infantry for many years.€€:When our scouts reported that Taurajo's most dangerous units were out on the hunt, we had to act quickly.€€''{{gossip|We sacked the town?}}''€€:<Hawthorne wrinkles his brow.>€€:I would prefer not to use the term 'sacked,' but yes, the attack went off flawlessly. We removed Taurajo from the equation, confiscated its arms, and destroyed its smithing facilities. The assault gave our forces considerable breathing room and knocked the enemy off balance.€€:Nonetheless, during the assault, I instructed my men to leave a gap open in our lines...€€''{{gossip|Why did you do that?}}''€€:Taurajo had a significant civilian population. I wanted to ensure that they could escape the fighting, and many did, finding refuge in the north.€€:There are some, even in [[High Command#Alliance High Command|Alliance High Command]], who argued that I let an opportunity slip away. That I should've taken hostages. But I don't see the value in those sort of terror-tactics.€€:Hear me out, <name>: I want this war to end someday. It won't ever stop if we butcher or imprison civilians.€€:I just pray that there are those on the other side who see things as I do.€€==Speculation==€{{Speculation}}€Considering he wears the Theramore Tabard and his wife says that she came to the Barrens from Theramore, they may have been citizens of Theramore.€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==References==€{{Reflist}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wowpedia:External_links_policy before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-NPCsearch}}€€{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawthorne}}€[[Category:Humans]]€[[Category:Northwatch Expeditionary Unit]]€[[Category:Quest givers]]€[[Category:Southern Barrens NPCs]]€[[Category:Deceased characters]]
