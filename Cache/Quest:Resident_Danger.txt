None of our kind are eager to bring blade and arrow against creatures that were once our friends, but I grow fearful that they are going to set their sights on [[Dolanaar]] soon.€€The biggest concern to me are the furbolg in [[Ban'ethil Hollow]] and [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]s. I need you to travel to the west, make your way into the Barrow Den, and kill as many of the Gnarlpine as you can. We probably won't have many more chances to limit their strength - be swift. €€== Rewards ==€You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}€€== Progress ==€{{text|say|Sentinel Kyra Starsong|Some of our huntresses have already made their way to Ban'ethil Barrow Den.  They will find you when you get inside.  Go ahead and speak to [[Citarre Mapleheart|Citarre]] to secure a ride there.}}€€Are their numbers weakened?€€== Completion ==€Impressive. I hope my huntress carried her weight.€€If we continue with this fervor, we may yet still free Teldrassil from the corruption that Alexstrasza herself could not burn out. €€== Gains ==€*790 [[XP]]€*250 reputation with [[Darnassus]]€€==Progression==€{{A Troubling Breeze}}€€== Patch changes ==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{elinks-quest|13945}}
