We're taking a beating in the [[Southern Barrens]] and need your help! Are you interested in lending the [[Alliance]] a hand?€€[[The Bomb|The bomb]]? Yea, it's a problem, but Stonetalon isn't exactly prime real estate. This place was a dump before the [[Horde]] sunk their claws into it!€€I'll leave the choice in your hands. If you want to help us out in the Barrens, take my horse, [[Blue Steel]]. He's grazing at the crossroads south of here. He'll get you past the orc blockade.€€== Completion ==€Kosak sent you, eh? Surprising. I thought for sure that he'd be dead by now.€€Well if you made it past the blockade then you definitely have something that we can use.€€Now, do you have any news of the Horde? What are they doing? Where are they going? Tell me everything.€€==Progression==€{{NEBC, DR, Aparaje/Grimtotem Alliance}}€€==Notes==€The horse, [[Blue Steel]], is at {{coords|60|70|Stonetalon Mountains}}. Head due south from [[Windshear Hold]], then turn to the road leading southeast at the first crossroads. Blue Steel is at the next crossroads, the one with signs.€€== Patch changes ==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{elinks-quest|25765}}
