You have done much for the [[Mag'har]]. No one could ever deny your service to my people. Alas, the time of the Mag'har is at an end. You have shown me, more than anything, that I am unfit to lead these people. My cursed blood runs too deep. I will not... I cannot become the second [[Grom Hellscream|Hellscream]] to damn the orcs.€€Please, <name>, return to the Greatmother and tell her what I have told you. I am too ashamed to see her... to look into her eyes.€€== Rewards ==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Mag'hari Huntsman's Leggings€|Mag'hari Ritualist's Horns€|Mag'hari Scout's Tunic€|Mag'hari Warlord's Legplates}}€{{itembox|You will also receive:€|Insignia of the Mag'hari Hero}}€€== Dialogue ==€:What did Garrosh tell you, <name>?€€{{gossip|''Garrosh is beyond redemption, Greatmother.  I fear that in helping the Mag'har, I have convinced Garrosh that he is unfit to lead.''}}€€:<Greatmother Geyah nods, accepting your answer.>€€:I can no longer fight the spirits, <name>.  My time has long since passed.  Once again, I must thank you for all that you have done.  While Garrosh may be unmoveable, many of my people have been lifted by your accomplishments.  They are now willing to fight for our rights as a unified clan.€€{{gossip|''I have done all that I could, Greatmother.  I thank you for your kind words.''}}€€:<Greatmother Geyah smiles at you.>€€:You remind me of my son, <name>.€€:He was an immovable mountain.  A pillar of strength and honor.€€:<Geyah's eyes well up with tears.>€€:He sacrificed himself so that we could survive.  So that generations of orcs after him could be born into a world without the blood curse...  Without [[Gul'dan]] and his [[Dark Horde|Old Horde]]...€€:<Geyah stares into the distance, lost in thought.>€€:Oh [[Durotan]], how I wish you could be here.  Your people so desperately need you...€€{{gossip|''Greatmother, you are the mother of Durotan?''}}€€:<Greatmother Geyah nods.>€€:Did you know my son?€€[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]] ''Greatmother, I never had the honor.  Durotan died long before my time, but his heroics are known to all on my world.  The orcs of Azeroth reside in a place known as [[Durotar]], named after your son.  And...  <You take a moment to breathe and think through what you are about to tell the Greatmother.>€€:<Greatmother Geyah's violet eyes lock onto yours.>€€:Yes...€€{{gossip|''It is my [[Thrall|Warchief]], Greatmother.  The leader of my people from my world.  He...  He is the son of Durotan.  He is your grandchild.''}}€€:<Tears stream down Greatmother Geyah's face.>€€:I...  I...  Durotan survived to have a child?  The child [[Draka]] told me of before they left...  It was their greatest fear...  To raise a child in this world.  On the other side of that gate was their only hope.  I dared not tell Durotan, but secretly, I begged the spirits to watch over them- to protect their child and to give them strength.€€:I...  I must see my grandchild.  I must see him.  Please, I am too weak.  You must tell him.  Before I leave this world...€€{{gossip|''I will return to Azeroth at once, Greatmother.''}}€€== Completed ==€<Tears stream down Greatmother Geyah's face.>€€Thrall is coming.  I know he will be here soon. €€{{rfg-section}}€Seek out your warchief. Tell him that I await him here...€€== Transcript from final cutscene ==€''When you talk to Greatmother Geyah, you will see many of Thrall's Kor'kron elite guards aligned in two rows of wolfriders at the entrance of Garadar. Thrall will appear by Garrosh, and will start walking uphill toward the Main Hall. There Thrall kneels down in front of Greatmother Geyah, and sits. Thrall will stay there for a few hours talking to her. The Horde gets buffed. You will see thunderbolts spreading and jumping from player to player throughout Nagrand.''€€:{{text|emote|War drums echo in the distance.}}€:{{text|yell|'''Thrall yells:''' At long last, I am home...}}€:{{text|emote|Thrall, [[Drek'Thar]] and the Kor'kron honor guard approach from the east.}}€:''Three defenders speak, choosing random lines off of this list.''€:{{text|say|'''[[Garadar Defender]] says:''' He carries the [[Doomhammer]]!}}€:{{text|say|'''Garadar Defender says:''' I am unworthy, son of [[Durotan]].
