The source of this corruption definitely came from something external—no surprises there—but it appears that in this case they've been eating something afoul. A large mammal probably. Most likely a bear.€€Search the beach for a bear carcass for me. Slightly east of there would make the most sense, on the inland side of the beach. Bring me the sample back at town.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€Welcome back!  Did you find that bear sample that I was looking for?€€==Completion==€This definitely looks like the stuff they were eating. Let me take a closer peek... €€== Notes ==€The carcass you are looking for is almost due South-East from the buzzbox.€€==Progression==€{{Buzzbox 413}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13527}}
