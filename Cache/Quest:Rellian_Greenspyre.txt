He is a [[druid]] that resides at Wellspring Hovel, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings. He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with.€€Thank you, <name>. I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors.€€You will find Wellspring Hovel along the road heading west out of Dolanaar, on the way to Darnassus.€€==Progress==€Hello...€€And how may I help you?€€==Completion==€Ah, a timberling seed?  I wanted to try growing one of these to help Denalan with his studies.€€But I'm afraid I've discovered that a corruption has grown in many of the timberlings, and seeds from such creatures carry their parent's taint. They are beyond my talents to repair.€€Denalan is very skilled with things that grow.  He may find a cure for future timberlings.  He may be their only hope.€€== Notes ==€You will need one inventory spot to accept this quest and receive the Timberling Seed, which is required to complete this quest.€€Make sure to also pick up [[Quest:Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei]] in [[Dolanaar]] along the way, as it takes you to the same general area.€€==Progression==€{{A Troubling Breeze}}€€==External links==€{{elinks-quest|922}}
