It's an apt name: these reeds run red with the blood of some of my best men.€€I've sent out recon patrols to crush the quilboar and report on the Horde troop movements, but not all of them return. They could use your support out there.€€Patrol the fields and seek out the Desolation Grunts that are causing us so much grief. Do not expect them to surrender; their Warchief has instructed them to fight to the death.€==Completion==€Very good. We may never drive the Horde completely from these lands, but with a strong presence we can undermine their will to fight.€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{cost||30}}€==Gains==€*2,710 [[XP]]€*+250 rep with [[Stormwind]]€== Patch changes ==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€== External links ==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|25043}}
