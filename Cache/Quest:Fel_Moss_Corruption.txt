Perhaps I can task you with something a little more important.€€As you may well know, the corruption in [[Teldrassil]] was supposedly wiped away. Yet something lingers. The creatures have not calmed and all manner of problems still plague us.€€I need you to deal with the grellkin that have gathered to the west, and while you're there, I want you to search them for fel moss. This will help me determine from where this continuing corruption stems.€€==Rewards==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:€|Canopy Leggings€|Tracking Boots€|Viny Gloves€|Moss-Encrusted Chain Pants}}€{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|||50}}€|q=3|Healing Herb}}€€==Progress==€Satisfy my suspicions, <name>. Bring to me fel moss from the grellkin.€€==Completion==€Your service to the creatures of Shadowglen is worthy of reward, <name>.€€You confirmed my fears, however. The grells have are still tainted by fel moss, despite Teldrassil's blessing. Something sinister remains within the tree. I can only hope that the Gnarlpine tribe of furbolgs are free of the corruption, or we are still in grave danger.€€I will look into this further and contact those who might be of aid. Thank you, <class>.€€==Progression==€{{:Night elf starting experience}}€€==Patch changes==€* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Moss-Encrusted Chain Pants]] added as a reward.}}€* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|28714}}€€[[pl:Quest:Fel Moss Corruption]]
