We are mortal now, and no matter how much we desire otherwise, we are deserving of our new place in this world.€€[[Bashal'Aran]], down the road to the south, once a city of our ancestors, it now is home to their cursed ghosts.  We held hope of salvation for them as with ourselves, but we have left them in torment for too long.  It is time to extinguish the Final Flame of Bashal'Aran.€€{{text|say|Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea|Be sure to stop by the bridges southeast of town.  You should be able to secure a [[nightsaber]] to get you down to the ruins.}}€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Progress==€The flames of Bashal'Aran were beacons of hope for our fallen ancestors.  We cannot abandon hope entirely, but it is time that we come to terms with the fate that we've earned.  They will find peace in a final death, and in time, we will join them again.€€==Completion==€You have our thanks.  It is time that we leave the past behind us, and start looking to our future. €€== Notes ==€The flame has a blue field of energy around it, sheltered by a small roof.  When the brazier is extinguished, a [[Cursed Highborne]] and [[Wailing Highborne]] will spawn to attack you.€€{{text|yell|Cursed Highborne|How dare you disturb our last link to this world?!}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13562}}
