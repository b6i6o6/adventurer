I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly.€€The first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|350}} (+{{coppercost|510}} at max level)€€== Progress ==€<Buzzbox 413 hums at you expectantly.>€€==Completion==€<The machine crackles loudly, and then [[Wizbang Cranktoggle|Wizbang's]] static-ridden voice becomes audible.>€€Lovely! I hope you didn't kill too many of them. We're not trying to wipe out the population, we just need to get to the source of this corruption quickly! I'm proceeding with the analysis now. €€==Progression==€{{Buzzbox 413}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13521}}
