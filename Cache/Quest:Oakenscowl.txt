I had to rush [[Wellspring Hovel|here]] to find you! It's so simple really... the corruption has spread from timerling to timerling, but there's but one that is the source.€€Oakenscowl, he's being poisoned by the largest tumor I have ever seen... I would call it gargantuan, even.€€Oakenscowl used to reside in a cave near [[Lake Al'Ameth|my lake]], but has since found his way to a nook to the northeast of here.  <Name>, Hunt[[wikipedia:Sic|[sic]]] down Oakenscowl and collect the tumor; remove this source of corruption from my home.€€("Oakenscowl: Oakenscowl lingers as a dire reminder of how deep Teldrassil's corruption can spread, turning a being of pure nature into something of nightmare.")€€==Progress==€Have you located Oakenscowl yet, <race>?€€==Completion==€I knew you were more than capable of ridding the lake of that horrible beast.€€It is a distressing situation; Oakenscowl was once a grand leader amongst his kind... but corruption does not discriminate between the lowly and the noble.€€The size of this tumor is quite disturbing, but I must study it to learn more about the disease that upsets the timberling population.€€Thank you, <name>.€€== Reward ==€{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dirtwood Belt|Moss-Covered Gauntlets}}€€You will also receive {{cost||3|50}}.€€==Progression==€{{A Troubling Breeze}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Level increased from 9 to 10.
