I can barely sit up.€€My friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it.€€If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family.€€==Rewards==€You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)€€==Completion==€Greetings, traveler. You seem to have an interest in my friend here. You're here on behalf of his friend Volcor then I imagine? If Volcor didn't come himself, he must be injured as well. I hope he recovers quickly.€€Grimclaw is too injured to be moved far and he's going to need some immediate treatment. I'm afraid I can't let you take him back just yet, but perhaps you can help me while I tend to him. €€==Notes==€Grimclaw is located with [[Keeper Karithus]]€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==Progression==€{{A Lost Companion}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13564}}
