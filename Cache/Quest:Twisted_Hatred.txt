The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home.€€He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of [[Fel Rock]], to the north, where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul.€€You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head.€€("Lord Melenas: None speak of the traitorous tale of Melenas, but his presence serves as a bitter, embarrassing reminder that trust must be earned, not given freely.")€€==Progress==€Did you kill Lord Melenas yet? It is vital that he be taken care of quickly and quietly, <name>. His continued existence is an embarrassment to us all.€€==Completion==€With Lord Melenas laid to rest I can finally move on to other matters.
