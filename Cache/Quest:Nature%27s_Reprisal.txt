I have gathered some ireroot seeds. They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal.€€To our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat.€€== Progress ==€Did you have any success in routing those grellkin for us?€€==Completion==€Good. I know this probably wasn't very pleasant work, but we greatly appreciate it.€€I fear for our dear Teldrassil... it seems it is becoming more corrupt by the day, and our ignorance to the cause is plaguing me greatly.€€== Reward ==€You will receive: {{cost||1|75}} (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 90)€==Gains==€*630 [[XP]]€*+250 rep with [[Darnassus]]€== Patch changes ==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13946}}
