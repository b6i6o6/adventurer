These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them.€€If you wish to align yourself with the Great Moonstalker Spirit, take this incense to the land just south of the Ruins of Lornesta. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me.€€== Completion ==€I share these forests willingly, accepting night elf kind into my home, and on occasion calling them friend. Though they have been tainted greatly in recent memory, I can see in you the same strength, honor, and spirit that first endeared them to me.€€If you place value in the ferocity necessary to overcome all odds, then I am willing to call you my champion. Know now that if you side with my kind, the other spirits will not accept you, so consider your choice carefully.€€==Progression==€{{A Lost Companion}}€€==Patch changes==€*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}€€==External links==€<!-- Read http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:External_links before posting your links here.€Links that do not conform to the rules will be DELETED.€Repeat violations may result in a BAN.€Have a nice day. :) -->€{{Elinks-quest|13568}}
